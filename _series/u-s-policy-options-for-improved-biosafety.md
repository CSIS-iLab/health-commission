Though much policy work has been done in the past two decades, there remains a significant gap in U.S. capacities to address rising challenges in biosafety that stem from significant, rapid changes in science and technology. New biotechnologies are enabling scientists to design, create, or modify new life forms in ways not previously possible, but our ability to understand and manipulate life is not matched by a corresponding growth in knowledge in biosafety. In fact, we lack the fundamental research that illuminates how and why accidents happen in a biological laboratory, research necessary to create evidence-based mitigation measures to understand how accidents occur and how to prevent them. The CSIS Commission aims to evaluate gaps in current biosafety measures, explore concrete options for improving biosafety capacities, and build consensus on U.S. policy changes.
