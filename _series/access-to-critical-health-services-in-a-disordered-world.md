title: Access to Critical Health Services in a Disordered World

Access to critical health services degrades significantly as insecurity increases, health infrastructure collapses, and populations, including health care workers, are displaced. As access declines, the risk of dangerous outbreaks rises, and basic preventive health measures such as childhood immunizations and reproductive and maternal health care decline or cease altogether. Health security spirals downward. Higher attention must be paid to meeting critical baseline health needs in disordered settings. This requires identifying concrete new initiatives for the United States and its partners to uphold surveillance and response to outbreaks, immunizations, maternal and reproductive health, and protection against gender-based violence.
