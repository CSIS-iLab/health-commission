Would the U.S. military be able to meet its worldwide missions in the face of a large-scale disease outbreak, either naturally occurring or intentional? What is the Department of Defense role in a U.S. international disease response framework? The U.S. military may increasingly be called upon to operate in environments at risk of disease outbreaks. The lack of an integrated, comprehensive approach across the U.S. military to deal with health security threats hinders preparedness and poses challenges to future force readiness and force health protection. The CSIS Commission is examining how the U.S. militaryâ€™s responsibilities in homeland defense, biodefense and biosurveillance, and cooperative biological engagement can be better aligned and coordinated to promote military readiness and facilitate collaboration in international infectious disease response.
