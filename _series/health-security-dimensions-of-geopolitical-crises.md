The CSIS Commission is putting a focus upon select ongoing geopolitical crises of substantial importance to U.S. national interests in which there are significant health security concerns. The CSIS Commission has examined North Korea, with a special focus on multi-drug resistance tuberculosis, severe malnutrition and stunting, water and sanitation, and the decrepitude of its health system. In aggregate, these factors create a formula for implosion. Another emerging case is the Venezuela crisis, both the internal implosion of the health sector and the external exodus of over 1.8 million refugees into the surrounding region as of August 2018. Health security must be better incorporated into strategic thinking about these geopolitically important places.
