## Contributing

### Branching

When modifying the code base, always make a new branch. Unless it's necessary to do otherwise, all branches should be created off of `master`.

Branches should use the following naming conventions:

| Branch type               | Name                                                      | Example                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| New Feature               | `feature/<short description of feature>`                  | `feature/header-navigation` |
| Bug Fixes                 | `bug/<short description of bug>`                          | `bug/mobile-navigation`     |
| Documentation             | `docs/<short description of documentation being updated>` | `docs/readme`               |
| Code clean-up/refactoring | `refactor/<short description>`                            | `refactor/apply-linting`    |
| Content Updates           | `content/<short description of content>`                  | `content/add-new-posts`     |

When ready to merge, submit a Pull Request into `master`. All code will be reviewed by the lead developer on the project before being merged into `master`.

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you are making and why. If there are any issues associated with the commit, include the issue # in the commit title.

### CSS Styles

- This project uses the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) naming convention.
- This project uses [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io) to maintain a consistent code style. Errors are flagged in the console during development and can be automatically fixed by running `npm run stylelint-fix`.

### Includes

When creating a [Jekyll include](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) that accepts parameters, add it to the [Includes](INCLUDES.md) document with a description of what the include is, how to call it, and what the parameters are.
