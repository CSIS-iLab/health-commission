  the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, India. The hospital was established
  by Christian missionaries over a century ago, primarily for treatment of tuberculosis
  and other chest diseases. Tuberculosis is among the world's most infectious killers
  that affects more than 12 million people globally with 2 million deaths annually.
  India has three million people infected with TB and has an estimated 99,000 drug-resistant
  TB cases every year. A tiny fraction of those infected in India receive the proper
  drugs, even with a government-funded program. The World Health Organization has
  included India on the list of high-burdened countries that contribute to 80 percent
  of the world's TB problem. World TB Day is marked on March 24, 2015.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a complex, long-range global crisis threatening the foundations on which modern medicine is built. At least 2 million people are infected annually with resistant bacteria in the United States, costing an estimated $20-35 billion and resulting in 23,000 deaths. AMR encompasses all microorganisms that become resistant to drugs that were once effective against them. Rising rates of drug resistance in infectious disease like tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and malaria, as well as hospital-acquired infections, have elevated the issue of AMR, precipitating high-level dialogues, both international and domestic, focused on the pressing question of how best to contain and respond to this trend. AMR is now recognized as a top tier health security threat: if common infections become once again deadly, we face a potential “post-antibiotic apocalypse.” Through a security lens, as resistance threats become increasingly endemic in high conflict, high instability regions, risks of military exposure and possible retransmission grow, threatening military readiness.

There are persistent challenges in the fight against AMR. Despite efforts at crafting global and national action plans, the global response to AMR continues to fall far short, creating vulnerabilities for all. Although rapid detection of resistance strains and identification of possible hot spots are critical for slowing the spread of AMR, 40 percent of the world’s 10 million AMR cases go undetected. Mobilization of civil society – community leaders, providers, the faith community – lags in the United States and elsewhere. Further, despite urgent need for both new products to replace those rendered ineffective by widespread resistance, there are persistent obstacles to research, development, and dissemination of new tools. Industrial innovation is discouraged by weak market conditions and awareness of the potential for evolving resistance to quickly render new drugs obsolete. Action is needed to raise public awareness, develop new research and development models, and strengthen U.S. and international approaches to combat AMR.
