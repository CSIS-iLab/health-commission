  to sleep on the ground as they try to enter a temporary displacement camp but are
  blocked by Kurdish soldiers on July 3, 2014 in Khazair, Iraq. The families, many
  with small and sick children, have no shelter and little water and food. The displacement
  camp Khazair is now home to an estimated 1,500 internally displaced persons (IDP's)
  with the number rising daily. Tens of thousands of people have fled Iraq's second
  largest city of Mosul after it was overrun by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria)
  militants. Many have been temporarily housed at various IDP camps around the region
  including the area close to Erbil, as they hope to enter the safety of the nearby
  Kurdish region.

In today’s world, chronic wars and unstable and fragile states have proliferated, giving rise to the displacement of over 68 million people. This reordering of populations is not likely to be reversed in the near future and is already resulting in major, permanent, often insecure settlements. The traditional sources of global, domestic, and local order are increasingly frayed. Global disorder spans chronic and emerging conflicts, fragile states, gross malgovernance, and empty stateless spaces. It is here to stay, is evolving swiftly, and is generating destabilizing new health security threats.

Access to basic health services degrades significantly as security is reduced and populations are displaced. A persistent state of crisis, violence, and instability leads to the flight of indigenous healthcare providers and at times the collapse of health infrastructure, accelerated by the deliberate targeting of healthcare providers and other humanitarians. As access to health services and infrastructure declines, basic health measures such as immunizations, maternal healthcare, and family planning services decline or cease altogether, and the risk of dangerous outbreaks rises. We have only just begun to understand the true destabilizing consequences of the impairment and destruction of health systems: in driving upwards mortality and illness, now and into the future; in driving mass migration; and in generating enormous reconstruction costs. It is critical that there be much stronger and more sustained investment in and protection of health infrastructure in fragile settings and in countries receiving refugees. This reality of the disordered world demands U.S. leadership and action to ensure health security.
