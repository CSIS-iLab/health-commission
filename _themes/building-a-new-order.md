Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a political paralysis in such key institutions as the UN Security Council, G-7, and G-20 and a conspicuous dearth of high-level diplomacy on global health security issues. The Commission will weigh in on the many efforts to reform the current global health, development, and health security institutions and partnerships, including the World Health Organization and the Global Health Security Agenda, and it will advance a renewed U.S. health security diplomatic strategy for the Covid-19 era.

The Commission will recommend steps that the United States should take to rebuild a more effective and responsive international order, both politically and operationally. This will include recommendations for how the United States can revitalize its relationship with the European Union and other key partners and allies in an effort to achieve a united reform effort.

The Commission will also examine the toxic U.S.-China strategic competition, and options for achieving a more effective and pragmatic interaction with China on health security issues. The Commission will examine options to secure markets and supply chains and address overreliance on foreign manufacturing (particularly Chinese manufacturing) for critical medical supplies and equipment.
