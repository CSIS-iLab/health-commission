A Ugandan Health Ministry spokesman confirmed the move on Thursday hours after officials declared that a **50-year-old Congolese woman had become the second patient to die of the disease in Uganda**; her grandson was the first confirmed Ebola death in Uganda, and the boy's 3-year-old brother is also infected and is currently undergoing treatment. Ugandan Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng said as of Thursday afternoon there was **"no confirmed case" of the Ebola virus in the country after DRC officials successfully repatriated five infected people** earlier in the day. Three people suspected to have contracted the disease are being treated in isolation at the Kasese district's Bwera Ebola Treatment Unit, Aceng added, while health workers were establishing contact with 27 people believed to have come into contact with the two deceased.

[CDC Activates Emergency Operations for Ebola Outbreak in Eastern DRC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p0612-ebola-operations-center.html)

_CDC Newsroom, 6/12/19_

In a press release, CDC confirms that the three travel-associated cases in Uganda this week further emphasizes the ongoing threat of this outbreak and are working with the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) on the ground in the DRC and the American Embassy in Kinshasa to support the Congolese and international response. CDC’s activation of the EOC at Level 3, the lowest level of activation, **allows the agency to provide increased operational support for the response to meet the outbreak’s evolving challenges**. The risk of global spread of Ebola remains low. Activation of the CDC EOC does not mean that the threat of Ebola to the United States has increased or that changes are being made to CDC’s outbreak-related guidance.

_Hill, 6/12/19_

“**Rumors can be more devastating than the disease. And every time you have an epidemic of disease, you have an epidemic of rumors as well**,” said Sylvie Briand, the director of infectious hazard management at the WHO’s Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases Department. She calls the challenge of false rumors an “infodemic.” Twitter posts and stories on right-wing websites have claimed several cases of the Ebola virus have been confirmed in Laredo, Texas, brought in by a surge of migrants from the DRC. “There are no suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola in Texas right now. No one in Texas is currently being monitored for Ebola,” Lara Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email to The Hill. A spokesman for the CDC echoed Anton’s statement. Public health officials who have been battling the virus in Congo say the rumors and fearmongering have become a regular occurrence any time a new disease breaks out. “Misinformation and rumors and this fear of the disease, that’s common in every outbreak. That’s not specific to Congo or even to Ebola,” said Carlos Navarro, UNICEF’s principal adviser for public health emergencies. “**A lot of the misinformation and the rumors and panic is spread through social media**. We usually face two outbreaks at the same time, the virus and the misinformation,” Navarro said. “The epidemics of fear, the epidemics of panic, that’s what we have.””

Uganda is well-practiced at containing VHF outbreaks, including #Ebola. But even well-prepared environments can experience challenges and health facilities are often weak-points for control efforts. No country can take this for granted.
