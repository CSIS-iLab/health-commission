DRC Ebola News 8/20/19

The number of Ebola cases has **exceeded 2900**.

There were **10 new cases** as of August 19th. A child has died of the virus in Mwenga, South Kivu.

Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe confirms that a second vaccine will be used to stop the ongoing outbreak.

Rwanda is currently fast-tracking negotiations to buy at least 100,000 doses of an Ebola vaccine for a mass vaccination campaign that targets traders around the country’s border with DRC.

North Kivu deploys army troops to checkpoints in order to fight the Ebola virus.

Dr. Muyembe said that the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of the vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, and promised to end the outbreak in the next four months. USAID head Mark Green visited DRC, on Monday and promised that the organization will continue to work to end Ebola and invest in medicines and community development. Health officials have already vaccinated more than 197,000 people with the Merck vaccine.

It is not clear when the mass vaccination campaign will start, and the cost associated as well as the type of vaccine to be used. However, media reports suggest that the experimental vaccine to be used is backed by international health experts, including the WHO. The vaccine in question, BBC reported, is produced by Johnson & Johnson. BBC also reported on Tuesday that more than 60,000 traders in eastern DRC who cross the border regularly into Rwanda and Uganda are to be vaccinated. No case of Ebola has been reported in Rwanda.

General Ilunga Mpeko Edmond, commander of the North Kivu army, made a descent with some of his units at checkpoints at Goma entrances. Unlike armed groups, he said that Ebola will not be fought with weapons, but rather with the rules dictated by health workers. General Ilunga urges other troops in the nation to join the response and fight “this real threat to the homeland”. “In the army we have an oath: Never betray the Congo! And the one who does not respect hygiene measures or who does not contribute to the fight against Ebola, betrays the Congo, which is not good," he said.

2\. I believe there's another case at Mwenga (#4), likely also someone infected in hospital there.

Pinga: Does anyone know how this 70 yo woman in a remote town that can't be easily accessed due to insecurity caught #Ebola? There's no word yet that she traveled outside the area.
