There were **2 new cases** reported on November 25th.

2 cases were also reported over the weekend.

Over the past weeks, the number of new Ebola cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have dropped significantly, but violence between the DRC military and the local Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) has increased.

A new mobile lab could be a gamechanger during the next Ebola outbreak. It can be flown in to trouble spots by plane and driven to very remote locations and has rapid diagnosis and research materials onboard.

Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization (WHO) executive director of health emergencies, said in the past 2 weeks 40 civilians have been killed as a result of violence in affected areas, including 11 over the past weekend in the area of Beni. "In very key areas, the footprint of violence and insecurity has once again aligned itself with the footprint of Ebola," Ryan said. In Beni and Butembo, outbreak response has stopped because of local protests the ADF and military violence, and in Oicha and Lwemba, response has been hindered by military action. "Just when we need unlimited and unfettered access in key areas, we have lost it," he said. "I don't believe we are going to see an explosion of cases, but we are so close and have the opportunity to finish. Security has become the major obstacle to do that.”

The company that developed it, U.S.-based Integrum Scientific, says the first vehicle may soon be tested in Uganda. The idea was born out of “deep frustration” among scientists during the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where suspected Ebola patients were often held in quarantine rooms for a long time while their samples were shipped to other locations and tested, putting uninfected people at risk of infection by patients. The lab can be outfitted as a biosafety level 2 or 3 laboratory and comes with almost 10 meters of lab bench space, a -80 degree Celsius freezer, satellite communication, and two generators that can run on “dirty” diesel fuel. Built for traversing unpaved, muddy roads, it boasts a reinforced door and a security system to keep out unwanted visitors. Palmer Masume Netongo, a molecular parasitologist at the University of Yaoundé I in Cameroon who toured the vehicle says he sees potential. Integrum Scientific CEO Joseph Sgherza says he hopes the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other funders will support African countries to buy and operate the vehicles—which would cost around $700,000 each—themselves.

This is a stark reminder that #ebola is not the only crisis DRC has faced in 2019. Vaccinating children against measles in DRC is a complex issue with many obstacles, but one that @Gavi will continue to work with our partners to tackle.

Katembo’s symptoms tipped off hospital staff that he may have #Ebola but contact tracing (seeing his name on list of ppl who attended funeral of man who died of Ebola) confirmed it. @USAID is working w @imaworldhealth on disease surveillance in #DRCongo [http://bit.ly/2Xx6Pg0](http://bit.ly/2Xx6Pg0 "http://bit.ly/2Xx6Pg0")
