There were **6 new cases** as of August 26th.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warns that the recent medical advancements do not negate the importance of building trust and understanding in communities.

A Canadian research project in DRC centered around trust could assist with reducing misinformation spread.

IFRC’s warning comes as the death toll approaches 2,000 and as the total number of cases reaches 3,000. “The importance of these new treatments – and the continued roll out of vaccines – are not to be underestimated. But alone they are not enough. Now is the time to double down on efforts to engage at-risk communities,” said Emanuele Capobianco, IFRC’s Director of Health and Care. “For the treatments to work, people need to trust them and the medical staff who administer them. This will take time, resources and a lot of hard work.” Continued high levels of distrust mean that many Ebola patients are delaying or avoiding going to health facilities. More than 42 per cent of alerts that Red Cross receives to bury a loved one are coming from a death at home.

The project aims to engage with ordinary people in the Ebola outbreak zone and enlist respected members of the community to work with health officials, in part to combat inaccurate information that has been circulating about the deadly disease. The ongoing conflict in the outbreak zone has contributed to the mistrust of outsiders, providing fertile ground for misinformation to spread and lack of case report to Ebola Health Centers. The project involves recruiting respected members of communities, gaining their trust, teaching them about the disease, and training them to identify and monitor people who may have been exposed. The project is still in its early stages, researchers hope to move into outbreak villages and co-ordinate with NGOs already present in these communities.

Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe expressed his gratitude to China. The materials consisted of protective equipment and laboratory equipment, and will arrive in the DRC in three batches, the first arriving on August 29. A representative from the Chinese Embassy in the DRC expressed China’s continuous commitment to fight the ongoing outbreak along with the DRC government. "At the diplomatic level, we are strategic partners. With the friendly tradition, we are brothers. It is in this context that we must register this gift,” he said.

3\. The #Ebola hotspots now are Beni and Mandima. Beni has been at the center of this outbreak so often & for so long. It puzzles me that people haven't changed behaviors there to stop transmission. But apparently not enough have. There was one community death yesterday. At Beni.

More than 200,000 people now protected with the Ebola vaccine in #DRC. Hard to believe how quickly research has changed the #ebola public health landscape

Listening to Sister Xaverine explaining how the nursery in Beni works. A dozen #Ebola survivors, called the “lullaby singers”, take care of children whose parents are being treated or lost their lives to the virus. @UNICEFDRC #WeStandTogether #StopEbola
