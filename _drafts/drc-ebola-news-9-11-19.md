There were **7 new cases** as of September 10th.

While the intensity of the outbreak shows signs of easing in some areas and total case numbers are decreasing, WHO cautions that it is too soon to tell if this trend will continue.

DRC suffers from extreme food insecure, second only to Yemen. World Food Programme (WFP) is providing food to patients and feeding areas where people can be checked for Ebola.

_WHO AFRO, 9/10/19_

The continued risk of response efforts being slowed down or stalled by security events remains high. Slight declines in case numbers have been observed previously in this outbreak and have ultimately not been an indication of a substantial decline in transmission intensity or a sign of the end of the outbreak. The response will continue to focus on stopping the outbreak in the hotspot areas, such as Kalunguta, Beni, Mambasa, and Mandima through early case detection and thorough investigation, strong contact identification and follow up, and engagement with the local communities.

The estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 10 September, US$ 54.9 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019.

WFP feeds Ebola survivors for up to a year after they are cured to help them regain their strength. “When you get Ebola you lose a lot of weight -- some people lose up to 10 kilos. Nutrition is crucial to ensure that these people can recover faster and get back to normal life,” said Deborah Nguyen, the southern Africa region spokesperson for WFP who was in the eastern DRC. Food becomes even more valuable if organizations such as WFP can provide feeding areas where people can be checked for Ebola, but also receive sustenance at the same time.

Meanwhile, stigma remains a potent ingredient in affected areas. Those who have jobs cannot necessarily go back to work in a weakened state, but Nguyen said that after speaking to families affected by Ebola, those who were employed lose their jobs because people are scared. “No one wanted to approach them, even their own family, no one wanted any contact with them; they were stigmatized and very isolated,” she said. Healthcare is important, food is key, but this issue is destroying the fabric of communities.

I went to DR Congo to see what it means to battle one of the most deadly viruses in cities tortured by war. Would love if you read my piece on how the region & #Ebola responders w/the @WHO are faring, out today in @NatureNews (Thread)

When mothers are stricken with #Ebola, their daughters often take on more responsibilities. Instead of going to school, they run the household and care for their younger siblings. #DRC

Dr Michel Yao – @WHO head of on-the-ground operations for this #Ebola outbreak in #DRC – is taking “the field” to partners & donors in Europe this week. Today, he met with @Sida & @SweMfa to thank #Sweden for its continued support to the response & discuss operations in DRC.
