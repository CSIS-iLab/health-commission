“#Ebola: 1 new case on Feb. 5, at Beni. Ebola does not seem to want to quit Beni. Has gone back & back & lingers still. There must be a lot of vaccinated people at Beni by now. No deaths yesterday. Totals: 3430 cases, 2251 deaths.”

“1. There was 1 case reported on Feb. 4, at Beni. It was a community death. So that pretty much guarantees there will be more cases in Beni in coming days. 3429 total cases & 2251 deaths.”

“2. More info on this new [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) fatal case: Person was not a known contact of an earlier case. Not good. There's currently only 1 known transmission chain. Have to hope they figure out this person was part of it. He or she stayed in the community sick for 9 days. Ugh”
