_ReliefWeb, 12/16/19_

After the coordinated attacks against the response teams in Mangina and Biakato on the night of 27-28 November, United Nations agencies, MONUSCO and the Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) launched a joint plan including the establishment of an air bridge between Beni and Biakato to improve security support and allow the full resumption of Ebola control activities in the area, in coordination with the Congolese authorities. Before the attacks that claimed the lives of four response workers, Mangina and Biakato were among the last hotspots of the epidemic, and the number of Ebola cases had dropped sharply. Since then, activities have been kept to a minimum and have had to be suspended for several days.

_CIDRAP, 12/16/19_

Over the weekend at least 43 people, including a pregnant woman, were killed in Beni, one of the epicenters of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's current Ebola outbreak, as officials tallied eight new cases of the deadly disease. According to human rights organizations interviewed by the Associated Press, ADF's goal is to pit civilians against the DRC military. The ADF, which has been associated with the Islamic State, is active in eastern DRC. Violent attacks have almost always spurred on new Ebola cases in their wake during the 17-month-long outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC. The DRC's Ebola technical committee said cases over the weekend were in Mabalako.

_Homeland Preparedness News, 12/17/19_

WHO reported that one individual was a potential source of infection for 17 people. This individual’s infection represents the second time they were documented as infected over six months. An investigation has been launched into the case to understand it better, especially given that while relapse cases are rare but do happen, actual reinfection has never before been documented.

\#Béni, Quartier Ngongolio. @JolieMilede @WHO #RCCE is meeting with communities. Vigilance about Visitors coming from #Ebola current Hotspots and the importance of early transfert to Health facility. Population is afraid about the possibility of case importation.

@w_s_taylor

More people are surviving #Ebola than ever before, but the virus can still be passed on in both semen and breast milk. Women and children are the majority of victims, so why isn’t this a key part of the general #DRC prevention messaging? #globalhealth
