There were **8 new cases** as of September 11th.

Eteni Longondo, DRC’s new health minister, has three major national health priorities, one of which includes fighting the current outbreak.

DRC’s new government was finally sworn in last week. Since Tshisekedi became president in January, many have questioned if DRC’s current administration is really a change.

Longondo’s first priority is to strengthen the health system and its administration. The second is to curb the multiple epidemics currently raging in the country. In addition to Ebola, measles is also raging in the country. His last priority is improving governance. He plans to better collaboration with health partners and “regain lost trust”. A physician by training, Longondo has [experience](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/news/2019/08/28/eteni-longondo-mph-2015-named-head-ministry-public-health) in DRC and Switzerland. He also worked at the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) and served as Deputy Secretary General for Finance and Logistics.

The DRC battered with political paralysis during the extended electoral delay between 2015 and 2018. The country’s change in leadership has created new momentum, and opportunities to revitalise a regional approach to peace in the eastern DRC; stabilising this region was one of Tshisekedi’s campaign promises. This is a complicated task, and one that numerous national and international actors have been engaged in with limited success for 20 years. Tshisekedi’s more open and cooperative attitude towards and engagement with the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) is a positive first step in the right direction. So too is his concerted engagement with regional leaders from Uganda, Rwanda and Angola. Tshisekedi’s chance is that his controversial ascendance to the presidency was accepted as a change that was better than the _status quo._ He faces tough realities and constraints, but with the local and international community on the side of change, he has formidable allies if he wants to set the DRC on a new path.

But the pit in my gut after writing are memories of Congolese whose lives are torn apart by violence & poverty. I asked @Chikwe_I about the #Ebola responders &he said “In some ways, they are paying for all of us ignoring the situation in this part of the continent for many years”
