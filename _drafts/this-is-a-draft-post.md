**The Trump administration’s desire to crack down on global human trafficking may restrict U.S. efforts to fight Ebola in the DRC**. As a Tier 3 country, DRC is subject US aid restrictions. On Tuesday, in an effort to ensure USAID can implement its own strategy, Sen. Robert Menendez introduced a bill that would grant the administrator broad authority to carry out activities in DRC and neighboring countries, “including assistance intended to lower community resistance to interventions that the administrator assesses will facilitate efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak.”

**For at least 5 days, response teams have not been able to carry out all the necessary response activities in Butembo**, such as active case finding in the community, vaccination and dignified and secure burials, due to insecurity. Butembo's sub-coordination teams partially returned to work today. However, some health areas in Butembo town remained inaccessible for security reasons. Only 4 new cases were reported today.

**The triage of the Masiki Health Center in Katwa Health Zone was set on fire on Tuesday, May 7, 2019.**

**A dignified and secure burial team officer was murdered in Vuhovi** on the night of May 7 to 8, 2019.

The number of infected health workers has risen to 97, with 34 deaths. (One of the new cases had been vaccinated.)

_Devex, 5/9/19_

The Trump administration’s desire to crack down on global human trafficking may restrict U.S. efforts to fight Ebola in the DRC. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the U.S. Department of State designates countries to three different tiers depending on their commitment to preventing people trafficking. These designations are laid out in the annual “Trafficking in Persons” report, and countries placed in the highest tier — Tier 3 — are subject to U.S. aid restrictions. As the number of Ebola cases has surged past 1,500 and responders face violent resistance in parts of eastern DRC, USAID plans to implement “a new strategy to improve community engagement and trust through development activities to foster access for health workers,” Sen. Robert Menendez shared at the hearing. The potential problem is that DRC’s status as a “Tier 3” country implies that without a presidential waiver — which President Trump elected not to issue the country for fiscal year 2019 — nonhumanitarian assistance should be prohibited. In a statement, Menendez pointed to a lack of clarity from the administration on “which activities should be restricted due to TIP sanctions,” and he suggested that he has heard little assurance that the expanded activities USAID plans to pursue in Ebola-affected parts of DRC would be permitted under the administration’s stricter approach. “I’m concerned ... that the decision to suspend nonhumanitarian assistance under the administration’s strict interpretation … of DRC’s Trafficking in Persons Tier 3 designation is going to prevent \[US\]AID from successfully employing this strategy,” Menendez said Wednesday. “Has the White House approved the strategy to reduce community resistance \[to Ebola treatment and prevention\]?” he asked Green. “It’s still being finalized, but I think … we’ve reached awareness, and we’re pushing a much more aggressive approach. It’s not been finalized yet,” Green responded. On Tuesday, in an effort to ensure USAID can implement its own strategy, Menendez introduced a bill that would grant the administrator broad authority to carry out activities in DRC and neighboring countries, “including assistance intended to lower community resistance to interventions that the administrator assesses will facilitate efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak.” “I fully support the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, but the sanctions authorized by that law were never meant to cost innocent lives,” Menendez said in a statement. The Trump administration’s heavy-handed approach to human trafficking-related aid restrictions has reverberated beyond DRC.

_Yahoo News, 5/9/19_

“We’re very concerned. This outbreak does have the potential to be the largest outbreak if things remain unchecked and cases continue at the current pace,” Ray Arthur, director of the CDC’s Global Disease Detection Operation Center, told Yahoo News. “This outbreak has been going for a year now, the first cases were actually in April of 2018, but the outbreak wasn’t recognized and declared until August. But over the last three or four weeks we’ve seen approximately one-fifth of all the cases, which represents a marked increase.” A proven component to containing past Ebola outbreaks, tracking and monitoring an infected patient’s contacts has been difficult in the densely populated war zone, a fact that has further necessitated the need for a robust supply of vaccine. Merck, the American pharmaceutical company that has developed the yet-to-be FDA-approved vaccine, is working to ramp up production, but the scale of the need has prompted the W.H.O. to propose a strategy of cutting the dosage so as to stretch supply. Still, Arthur said, the prospect of mass vaccination for Ebola remains years off. “If we could turn on a switch and do that overnight we would. The U.S. government is working very closely with Merck to monitor their production schedule and supply, but it’s not easy to ramp up the production of a vaccine quickly,” Arthur said. “You have quality control testing, etc. There are efforts to ramp up the supply but the timetable is not as fast as you might expect.” In the meantime, CDC has deployed personnel to the region. “The longer the transmission goes on with the increased number of cases one of our concerns is the larger population centers in North Kivu, a city called Goma, which is on the border with Rwanda and we’re quite concerned with cases occurring there which would increase the likelihood that they would cross over the border,” Arthur said. “There’s a lot of border traffic, in the neighborhood of 10,000 crossings each day, between DRC and Uganda. Given that concern, CDC has deployed over 100 staff members to three at-risk countries, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, to help those counties prepare to respond to a case should it occur.” Arthur said mistrust of outsiders is common in North Kivu and a social media disinformation campaign has led many to believe that the Ebola scare is a hoax, or that vaccinations actually cause the disease. The perfect storm of a deadly infectious virus, violent social upheaval and social media disinformation has health officials on edge and bracing for more bad news. “Every wrinkle that could have happened in this outbreak seems to have occurred,” Arthur said. “That’s why we’re concerned given the current trajectory. Definitely, things are going to get worse before they get better.”
