DRC Ebola News 8/22/19

There were **7 new cases** as of August 21st.

The third case identified in South Kivu was in a patient who contracted the virus at a health center where other Ebola patients had been treated.

More than 5 cases of suspected patients escaping health facilities have been reported in Beni.

A march organized by the governor of North Kivu is being held in Goma to support the Ebola response.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will give $23 million to Merck to produce more doses of its investigational Ebola vaccine.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will travel to DRC next week to assess the situation and mobilize additional support for the response.

_CIDRAP, 8/21/19_

The details on the nosocomial transmission emerged in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) latest situation report on the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC. In the past week, two more DRC regions far from outbreak hot spots have reported cases: South Kivu province and Pinga health zone, which is in North Kivu. The WHO is still investigating how the case in Pinga contracted the virus, but investigations have shown a mother and child in Mwenga, South Kivu, became infected after contact with a patient from Beni. Mwenga and Beni are about 473 miles apart, and South Kivu province shares a border with Rwanda and Burundi. The WHO said 11% of all cases in this outbreak have come from nosocomial transmission, and 5% have involved healthcare workers.

While Beni remains the epicenter of Ebola, patients who may be infected with the Ebola virus escape from integrated health facilities (triage centers) when they think they will be transferred to an Ebola Treatment Center (ETC). A nurse from the Kasanga Health Center commented on the ignorance of some patients who consider ETCs to be a place to sleep. She says that caregivers do not give up when suspected patients escape, but instead put all possible means to find them. Last week, several suspected patients fled the triage points of Mandrandele, Butsili, Rwangoma and Kasanga health centers, and some of them have not yet been found despite the joint efforts of response teams and the local authorities.

Today’s march in Goma is organized by the provincial governor, Carly Nzanzu Kasivita, in collaboration with health sector partners. It starts at the BEDGL roundabout and will end to the ONC forum where the provincial authority will address the population, in a message of awareness of community membership in the fight against this epidemic. Many other local organizations will also take part, including banks, portfolio companies, public administration divisions, religious organizations, political parties, women’s associations, and students. This event reinforces the community outreach approach advocated for by Ebola response teams.

With the new $23 million funding, HHS will have spent about $176 million to support development of V920, the agency said. The Merck vaccine is available for people at risk of contracting Ebola in the ongoing DRC outbreak, through an expanded access protocol. HHS has also provided funding for the Department of Defense to transport bulk vaccine materials from Merck’s facilities in Germany to its unit in Pennsylvania to produce additional doses of the vaccine.
