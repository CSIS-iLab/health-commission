title: Department of Defense Contributions to the U.S. Covid-19 Response, at Home
  and Abroad
content_type: commentary
excerpt: |-
  The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) should be systematically incorporated into any U.S. government vision on international global health security. The United States should build on what has been learned and achieved through DOD support at home to the civilian-led Covid-19 response, as well as past DOD contributions to pandemic response overseas, and incorporate long-standing DOD international capabilities against biological threats. DOD should contribute to responding to the acute phase of the pandemic and build long-term preparedness capacities.

  DOD has considerable assets in three areas that can and should be included, when appropriate, to support the U.S. civilian-led international response:

  * Logistics, lift, and planning;
  * Biosurveillance and infectious disease research and development; and
  * Relationships built through decades of international collaboration in biosecurity and biosafety, ongoing global health engagements, and work in overseas laboratories.

  DOD already is playing a significant role in the procurement and delivery of 1 billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which President Biden has pledged to the COVAX vaccine solidarity mechanism to benefit 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries. A process of strategic planning for other likely DOD contributions to contain the global Covid-19 pandemic should begin right away.
