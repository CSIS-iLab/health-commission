There were **10 new cases** as of July 17th.

Majority of deaths in DRC are occurring in homes, or at health centers not equipped to deal with the outbreak. The Ebola response must go into where the cases are, which requires **embedding it into local communities.**

Authorities in DRC have intensified efforts to screen suspected cases of Ebola as the WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency.

Research on the 2014-16 Sierra Leone Ebola crisis has shown that learning from local responders is critical for effective response. Yet, calls from international and Congolese frontline workers that urge a rethink on the emergency response, with community-led interventions tailored to local context given priority, have gone unheeded. Armed violence is widespread in DRC, and there are very high levels of hostility to foreign intervention. **In North Kivu, “foreign” doesn’t even have to mean international; simply being from outside the local area is enough to be considered an outsider.** Those who seek treatment at Ebola Treatment Centers are at risk of being perceived as sympathetic to – or even complicit in – a response widely and violently condemned by some members of their communities. Less emphasis must be put on the international response and more on local staff and community leaders. **Allowing local people to lead the response does not mean there is no role for the international humanitarian community**. On the contrary, technical advice, response coordination and an emphasis on human rights remain important contributions the international response can offer.

Checkpoints are being installed on roads in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu and near entrances to airports and border posts, said Theo Ngwabidje Kasi, governor of Congo’s South Kivu province. A case of the viral-hemorrhagic illness was detected for the first time this week in Goma. Rwandan Health Minister Diane Gashumba said the authorities have vaccinated 2,600 health workers to prepare for the possibility of the disease crossing the border from Congo. “There is a need to be more vigilant and to avoid unnecessary visits to Goma,” she said.

DRC Health Minister @OlyIlunga says he accepts @WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a #PHEIC. Sounds like DRC may not have been enthusiastic about the idea. I certainly hear the country has been adamant about controlling all aspects of the response. (said in neutral tone)

@Laurie_Garrett

Dear @WorldBank -- you promised the world "never again" would an epidemic be allowed to reach pandemic threat point, as happened in 2014 #Ebola. Yet you've given paltry funds to current #DRC crisis. Now a PHEIC is declared -- RELEASE THE FUNDS.
