## The Issue

Timely and accurate information to assess disease burdens, track emerging outbreaks, and support disease prevention and control measures is essential in epidemic response. When optimized, the convergence of digital technologies and new data models with health systems, also known as “digital health,” can help ensure the necessary data and information are available in the right place, at the right time, and to the right people. This paper recommends a focused five-year U.S. initiative to pilot replicable U.S. models for scaling digital health within U.S. epidemic preparedness and response efforts in two to three partner countries.

## Overview

Timely and accurate information to assess disease burdens, track emerging outbreaks, and support disease prevention and control measures is essential in epidemic response. Over the past decade, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have increasingly transitioned from paper-based to digital information systems and are utilizing new technologies to collect data. This increasing uptake of digital technologies and data tools to support global health security allows countries to make more accurate and timely decisions for preventing, detecting, and responding to outbreaks. When optimized, the convergence of digital technologies and new data models with health systems, also known as “digital health,” can help ensure the necessary data and information are available in the right place, at the right time, and to the right people.[\[i\]](#_edn1)

<div style="border: 1px"> In the last decade, innovations in digital technologies have enabled rapid progress in the collection, analysis, presentation, and use of data to improve health outcomes. The field of knowledge and practice associated with any aspect of adopting digital technologies to improve health, from inception to operation, is known as “digital health.” Digital health approaches aim to strengthen available data and promote its use in decision-making. </div>

Over the last five years, the U.S. government has made a number of smart investments in a variety of digital tools and approaches and has worked to strengthen the capacity of local partners to utilize these tools.[\[i\]](#_edn1) While clear successes have resulted from these initial investments, significant challenges remain:

· Many health information systems are siloed and capture duplicate data, putting significant strain on health workers who collect, manage, and use this information.

· Health information systems are not always interoperable—they cannot always “talk” to one another—which hinders evidence-based decision-making.

· The capacity of stakeholders to design, manage, and support digital health systems, as well as effectively use data, is critically needed in many LMICs.

· Many countries lack the necessary governance structures, policies, and coherent national plans to support the utilization of data to inform decisions and actions in epidemic response.

· The U.S. government has not sufficiently leveraged the potential of the U.S. technology sector to advance digital health and global health security goals.

There is understandable skepticism about the successful application and utilization of digital technologies in fragile and disordered settings. This proposed initiative would be designed to prove that, with targeted strategic investments, it is possible to rectify these persistent challenges and realize the full potential of digital technologies in LMICs. We recommend that the U.S. government launch an initiative that will:

· Expand the use of interoperable data systems;

· Strengthen governance and national plans to share data and scale up proven tools under the direction of country health authorities;

· Build capacity and leadership to interpret data and act upon it; and

· Utilize new financing mechanisms to better leverage the potential of the U.S. technology sector.

This initiative will require a strategic, focused effort across all U.S. agencies engaged in global epidemic preparedness and response, and a modest investment—we recommend $20 million each year—as a component of Global Health Security Agenda investments across the CDC, USAID, and Department of Defense. New financing mechanisms, such as the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (USDFC), offer an important opportunity to create new partnerships and unlock private capital to advance digital health and epidemic preparedness.

Such an initiative will demonstrate proof-of-concept for a higher standard of U.S. coordination and engagement to strengthen digital health and generate learnings that will benefit other global health security efforts in the next decade and beyond.
