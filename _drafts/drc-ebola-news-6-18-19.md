## EBOLA: Kenya reassures public after false alarm

In a press conference staged at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Kenyan Health Minister Sicily Kariuki confirmed that the suspected case of Ebola in the country was negative and spelled out a list of preventive measures that Kenya had already taken. These included the installation of thermal cameras at entry points to detect people with high temperatures, as well as isolation units to host suspected cases. More than 250 health ministry workers have been deployed at entry points as part of this strategy.

## Uganda clears three experimental Ebola treatments, watches for spread

The treatments approved for shipment to Uganda were Mapp Biopharmaceutical’s ZMapp, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Regeneron, and Remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, said WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. The U.N. health agency has said there have so far been no known cases of Ebola spreading between people in Uganda - all recorded patients had traveled in from DRC where four experimental therapeutic treatments are already being used. Health workers and people who came in contact with infected people began receiving a Merck experimental vaccine in Uganda on Saturday.

## Tshisekedi’s EAC bid with suspicion

Tshisekedi expressed his wish for the DRC to become a member in a letter sent on 8 June to Rwandan president Paul Kagame, who chairs the regional bloc. The last country to join the EAC was South Sudan in 2016. This request is “a confirmation of President Tshisekedi’s stated priority to focus his regional policy on cooperation and integration,” says Olivier Nduhungirehe, secretary of state for the EAC at the Rwandan ministry of foreign affairs. The letter stated that Tshisekedi’s request “follows the ever-increasing trade between operators in the Democratic Republic of Congo and those in the States of the aforementioned Community”. Tshisekedi, who was invested as DRC president on 24 January, has already visited several EAC member countries, starting with Kenya on his first regional tour and travelling to Uganda and Rwanda in March, followed by Tanzania and Burundi on 13 and 14 June. Discussions between the Congolese president and his counterparts have, so far, focused largely on security issues. The regional organization that the DRC now wishes to join is mired in internal tensions. For several months Kigali and Kampala have been at each other’s throats; Burundi is under pressure from its neighbors ahead of next year’s presidential election as tensions in the country are high after mediation initiated by the EAC failed. The DRC’s request will be discussed at the next EAC summit, scheduled for November 2019.
