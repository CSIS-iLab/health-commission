title: 'Ukraine: The Human Price of War Episode 4'
content_type: video
excerpt: At the three-month mark of Russia's invasion, Ukraine, while fragile and
  vulnerable, is surviving. In the face of a long and bloody war of attrition unfolding
  in the East and the South, as Russia blockades Ukraine's access to the Black Sea,
  the human toll for Ukraine's citizens is likely to worsen. Can massive Western assistance
  reach Ukraine in time to defeat Putin? Can the transatlantic alliance hold together
  under mounting stress? An exceptionally high volume of Russian attacks on healthcare
  persists, drawing the condemnation of the World Health Organization leadership.
  An historic moment in international justice may be emerging, when it is possible
  to bring Russian war criminals to justice.
