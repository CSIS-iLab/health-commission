_WHO, 6/19/19_

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General, was speaking to Member States in Geneva after returning from a visit to DRC, where he reviewed the health response and met with leaders from multiple sectors to galvanize their commitment. “Political cooperation must come from across party lines and across borders,” said Dr Tedros. “Bipartisan political leadership in DRC is the only way that communities will eventually understand the threat of Ebola and take ownership in ending the outbreak. Meanwhile, other countries have a global responsibility to support the dedicated health responders who are bravely working to save lives.” During this visit, Dr Tedros met with Prime Minister Sylvester Ilunga Ilunkamba and opposition leaders, including Martin Fayulu and Mbusa Nyamwisi, as well as religious leaders and partners in Kinshasa, followed by meetings in Butembo, with community, religious, business leaders and partners, including non-governmental organizations, and other UN agencies. WHO is also facing a severe funding gap of US$54 million for the response, which risks decision-making being driven by financial capacity rather than operational needs.

@TheLancet editorial disagrees with WHO Emergency Committee decision against declaring a PHEIC for Ebola in DRC. "The decision appears more political than technical and that is a mistake."

About travel: The African Nations (soccer) Cup starts Saturday in Cairo. There appears to be a possibility that some people from North Kivu-Ituri will travel to Cairo to support the Congolese team. That bears watching.
