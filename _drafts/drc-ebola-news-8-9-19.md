There were **6 new cases** as of August 8th.

No new confirmed cases have been reported in Goma. All 256 contacts related to the first confirmed case in Goma (reported 14 July) have finished their 21-day follow up period.

MONUSCO, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the DRC, supported the Congolese National Police (PNC) to investigate a recent attack on an Ebola response team.

Witnesses say fears of the Ebola virus have brought border traffic between Rwanda and the DRC to a near standstill.

_MONUSCO, 8/7/19_

The investigations are to gather elements that would help identify the perpetrators of an attack on the Beni-Butembo road axes aimed at a convoy of the Ebola response team, with a view to possible prosecution. The United Nations (UN) technical and scientific police expert in Butembo, Silviu Anton, visited the scene of the incident for technical findings along with PNC Research and Investigation Squadron Team. Escorted to the scene by elements of the Armed Forces of the Congolese Democratic Republic (FARDC), they immediately conducted searches and detected several bullet impacts on the vehicles, one of which had its engine seriously damaged. No loss of human life was reported. MONUSCO Police often assist PNC investigators with their technical and scientific police expertise.

[Ebola Fears Slow Crossings at DRC-Rwanda Border](https://www.voanews.com/episode/ebola-fears-slow-crossings-drc-rwanda-border-3975286)

_VOA, 8/9/19_

Long lines and lengthy delays at the border crossings have left many traders frustrated. But officials say health checks are necessary to stop the spread of the deadly virus. “**We stay here waiting \[at the border\], even for five days or for one week to cross, and we pay as we wait**”, a woman said. Another woman, who has a shop in Goma but lives in Rwanda complains that she cannot reach her shop because of the delays. “They say the border is open, but look”, she says. The Rwandan government has not said the border is closed but is urging its people not to go to DRC.

7\. @WHO's #Ebola report always lists factors that are impeding efforts to stop the outbreak. I'm struck that this long list of challenges has remained unchanged for weeks. If transmission chains aren't traced better & community deaths halted, etc, etc how does this stop?

In eastern #DRCongo, USAID is working with partners to train health workers, engage communities, support health facilities, monitor cases, and more to stop spread of #Ebola.
