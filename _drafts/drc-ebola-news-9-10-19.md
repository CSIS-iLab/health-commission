_Africa News Network, 9/10/19_

Over 6,500 primary and secondary schools are in Ebola-affected areas of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu provinces. UNICEF figures show approximately two million children are returning to school in these regions this year. Officials are unanimous about the need to reinforce the sanitary devices to ensure the safety of pupils. In Goma, authorities required children to strictly follow hygiene rules; wash basins are installed at the entrance of enclosure areas and at the door of each classroom.

5\. Lest we get too reassured by the declining #Ebola case numbers in DRC, there's this: According to @UNICEF, still more than 1 in 4 Ebola cases is someone who is only spotted as Ebola-infected after they die in the community. This is how Ebola spreads.
