There were **18 new Ebola cases** in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as of June 25th, 2019.

New cases continue to occur in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with fluctuating transmission intensity.

A vaccination team and a psychosocial support team are the **latest victims of violent attacks in Beni.**

Experts will gather in Kinshasa on 28 June to discuss a thorny issue: whether, and how, to deploy a **second vaccine to supplement the limited supplies of the Merck shot**.

## Ebola hot spots shift as pattern of spread fluctuates

In their updated bulletin, WHO confirmed that in the past 10 days, officials have recorded nearly 100 new cases of Ebola in the ongoing outbreak, a sign of fluctuating transmission throughout North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Cases during the previous 3 weeks originated from Mabalako (36%; 88/245), Mandima (14%; 34), Beni (13%; 33), Katwa (7%; 18), Butembo (6%; 12) and Kalunguta (6%; 15).

The latest attacks on a vaccination and psychosocial support teams came after the death of a young man who died yesterday in an Ebola treatment center, who also had a twin brother who is a confirmed case-patient being treated for Ebola. The attacks resulted in no deaths, but the assailants wounded two police officers and burned a car. CARE, a humanitarian organization fighting global poverty, took note of the 1,500 fatalities benchmark by announcing a ramping up of their efforts in the region. The group will expand hand washing stations in schools and distribute hygiene and personal protection equipment, with an emphasis on girls and women, according to a CARE news release.

## As Ebola outbreak rages, plan to test second vaccine sparks debate

Fielding this second vaccine in DRC would also provide a rare opportunity to test another vaccine’s effectiveness. But some experts worry a new effort could drain resources from the primary vaccination campaign and complicate efforts to persuade people to get vaccinated. “Having two vaccines ... raises an important potential for confusion and skepticism,” says political scientist Rachel Sweet at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. DRC Minister of Public Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga told Reuters last month that he preferred to stick with one vaccine, so as not to “perturb the population.” The DRC convened this week’s meeting to help him and other officials “make an informed decision,” a government spokesperson says. A WHO advisory group has repeatedly recommended offering additional vaccines to lower-risk populations in the DRC. After reviewing two candidates, it recommended a vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson that requires two shots: one of a nonreplicating adenovirus that includes an Ebola surface protein, and then, 8 weeks later, a modified pox virus with several Ebola proteins that also does not replicate. The hope is that the combination will give long-lasting protection. Doses for 1.5 million people are now available, and scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine have produced a protocol for deploying them. They suggest offering shots to anyone more than 1 year old.

It appears Uganda is not vaccinating pregnant & lactating women with the experimental #Ebola vaccine. Not clear why. Use in these 2 high risk groups was recently approved & put into practice in DRC.

This morning I thanked partners for their support to health in #Uganda which has done a remarkable job in building strong health institutions and is dealing effectively with its #Ebola response.
