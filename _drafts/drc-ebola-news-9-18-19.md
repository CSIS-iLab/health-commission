DRC Health Minister André Eteni Longondo traveled to Gisenyi, Rwanda at the invitation of the Rwandan minister to exchange and implement strategies to fight Ebola. Longondo also visited the border between the DRC and Rwanda to see how the people of both countries collaborate. He expressed the wish not to see this disease spread to other villages. The Rwandan minister expressed her satisfaction with the meeting and reaffirmed her commitment to collaborate with DRC in the fight against Ebola. Longondo will return to Rwanda next month for a new assessment of the outbreak situation.

"Medical drones are the fastest means of transport. In outbreaks, we want responses as fast as possible. For an Ebola outbreak, we need to confirm it in time and transport vaccines in the next minute," said Dr. Susan Nabadda, the executive director of National Health Laboratory and Diagnostic Services in Uganda. "We take about six hours to get samples from Kasese to Kampala. But for drones, it would take a few minutes to get back the samples," she added. The Ugandan commissioner for clinical services at the ministry of health confirmed that there are currently discussions with partners about the process of introducing medical drones and that finalization is ongoing about financing strategies to support the technology.

On the good news side of the ledger, yesterday was indeed Day 21 since the most recent #Ebola case at Mwenge in South Kivu. A full incubation period without a case. If that spreading event was contained, that would be a very good thing. 2 active provinces is enough!
