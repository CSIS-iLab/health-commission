_ABC News, 2/3/20_

Dozens of people have been killed by rebel fighters in recent attacks on villages in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Militia wielding guns and knives raided several remote villages in the territory of Beni in North Kivu province last week, officials said. The recent attacks have been blamed on the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan-led rebel group that has long operated from Congolese soil in the mineral-rich borderlands with Uganda. The Congolese government provided a civilian [death toll](https://abcnews.go.com/International/global-death-toll-coronavirus-outbreak-rises-362/story?id=68717349) of 62 in the the minutes of Friday's cabinet meeting. However, a U.N. source told ABC News on Monday that the number of dead was up to 72 civilians and two Congolese soldiers.
