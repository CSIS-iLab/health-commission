_WHO, 8/15/19_

“Today is a day of celebration because we have two people here who have survived,” Dr Bachir Mbodj, Deputy Incident manager, WHO DRC Ebola response in Goma told the gathering of health workers, Ebola response partners, government officials and friends who had come to celebrate the release of the mother and child from the Ebola Treatment Centre at Goma Hospital on August 13. Their cases (the third and fourth in Goma) were detected quickly. “Mama Esperance and her son are alive because they came early for treatment. Sadly, Mme Esperance’s husband came too late, and could not be saved,” said Dr Bachir. “It is essential that everyone in the community knows that rapid detection of Ebola virus disease and early treatment saves lives.” Both Esperance and her son were offered life-saving treatment including drugs that are improving survival rates. There are currently no cases of Ebola in Goma.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said Burundi’s health ministry had begun vaccinating health workers at the Gatumba border crossing point on Tuesday using the Merck vaccine. “Although this vaccine is not yet approved and its commercial use is not yet authorized, it has been shown to be effective and safe during Ebola outbreaks in West Africa,” the WHO said in a statement. The statement did not say how many doses of the Merck vaccine would be available for the immunization campaign, which is getting financial support from GAVI.

Sources confirmed that it was a woman washing dishes in this river who alerted the public about the presence of these used materials, which serve for the dignified and safe burial of the people killed by the Ebola virus. A member of the local response team indicated that they were thrown away by a family member of a person who showed signs of Ebola, but the result was negative. "It was a woman and she had died bleeding from all its orifices, her family had alerted us ... luckily the result was negative, but as it was always necessary a safe burial, it was necessary to put the corpse in a mortuary bag and put gloves ... curiously, the person was buried there nearly a week ago but we find these effects thrown in the river," says Kambere Matembela who deplores this behavior.

2\. Safe burial teams, which seem to be the Ebola workers who really draw community ire, have been attacked again. A team investigating a burial at Nyiragongo (which is Goma) was pelted with rocks; another at Kalunguta was threatened by Mai Mai. 3 phones were stolen.

Good luck to all those getting their A–Level results today. And good luck to Claude who took his exams in an Ebola isolation unit.
