There were **10 new cases** as of August 5th.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is giving up its work on developing 2 potential Ebola vaccines and transfers it over to the Sabin Vaccine Institute.

Yesterday Uganda started the largest Ebola vaccine trial of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. It will involve up to 800 people.

A joint meeting between the health ministers of the DRC and Rwanda is scheduled today in Gisenyi, Rwanda.

In what it calls the “pre-epidemic phase,” the Rwanda Red Cross has been conducting simulations and took part in three national simulations conducted by the Rwandan Ministry of Health.

Last week Senator Bob Menendez called for immediate action to end the current Ebola outbreak in DRC, as he continues to rally behind S.1340, the Ebola Eradication Act of 2019.

GSK’s vaccine candidates - 2 designed to protect against Ebola and one against the Marburg virus - will be transferred to the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C., GSK said in a statement. There is no financial element to the agreement, a GSK spokesman said. The transfer agreement will see Sabin continue to develop the candidate vaccines, one of which - a potential Ebola shot known as ChAd3 - has been through mid-stage, Phase II, trials in Africa and could possibly be used to halt or limit future Ebola epidemics. GSK had put its Ebola vaccine work on hold after it was unable to progress the product through final stage, or Phase III, clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases. GSK said Sabin had agreed to a collaboration deal with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to further develop the vaccine candidates. The ChAd3 shot was originally developed by NIAID in collaboration with the Swiss-based firm Okairos, which was bought by GSK in 2013.

According to interim DRC health minister Pierre Kangudia, this meeting should lead to the adoption of a joint plea to be presented to WHO. "I have come to take stock of the field response teams and prepare a road map that we will propose to our Rwandan neighbors who would like to accompany us in this fight," said Pierre Kangudia. This meeting will also be attended by the DRC Ebola Response Coordinator, Dr. Muyembe.

There have been no Ebola cases in Rwanda so far, but neighboring countries remain prepared for the risk that the outbreak could spread. “We have really increased preparedness and readiness to ensure that the country is free of Ebola, but people cross the border on a daily basis from DRC to Rwanda, especially from Goma city so they are close,” said Dyrckx Dushime, president of the Rwanda Red Cross for Rubavu District, which is considered one of the most at-risk regions given its proximity to Goma. The objective of the simulations is to test the capacity and capabilities of the organization around logistics, infection prevention and control, case management, screening, and safe burial of suspected Ebola patients. If any gaps are identified, strategies are then developed to address them. Dushime explained why he believes Rwanda is Ebola-ready, and what it needs from the international community to keep up the preparedness efforts.

Under the Ebola Eradication Act of 2019, introduced by Sen. Bob Menendez, the United States would be required to provide all available tools and resources to the containment effort and bolster efforts to confront the outbreak. “We no longer have the luxury of half-hearted international engagement,” Menendez said. “We need a multifaceted, multi-sectoral, international response to get this under control. We know all too well that infectious diseases have no borders. It’s one airplane flight away from coming to our borders. And that has happened before.” The State Department currently lists DRC as a Tier 3 country for human trafficking, meaning that it could be sanctioned. The Trump Administration has used that designation as reason to limit is assistance on the Ebola issue. “\[The [TVPA](https://www.state.gov/international-and-domestic-law/)\] was never intended to hurt the most vulnerable in society, or to be used as an excuse to ignore a deadly epidemic with international implications…we’re shooting ourselves in the foot with unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles that serve no purpose and slow down our response even as the disease continues to kill more and more people.” Menendez said.

We have in all likelihood passed the 3000 #Ebola cases mark in #DRCONGO and if recent claims of a 50% undercount are accurate, that's 6000. Deeply distressing

So much work goes into trying to stop #Ebola from spreading. Eg. >900 people have been vaccinated in the past week because they are considered at risk of having contracted the disease from the 3 Goma cases. ID'ing, finding & getting them to agree to be vaxed = ton o' work.

Then: Our first @UNICEFDRC Ebola response team landed in Beni one year ago, straight from a previous Ebola outbreak in Mbandaka. Now: Over 200 staff working tirelessly to protect children from Ebola in affected regions of DR Congo. 👏
