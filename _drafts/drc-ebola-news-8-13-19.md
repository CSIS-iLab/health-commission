There were **6 new cases** as of August 12th.

Speaking about the 2 experimental Ebola treatments that significantly increase survival rate, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum said he “could not have imagined” that such a day would come.

Protest against an Ebola response team was observed today in the Majengo district, north of Goma.

Restrictions on entry into Rwanda by the Goma-Gisenyi border post have been strengthened.

The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated $10 million to the DRC Ebola response.

The 2 drugs have performed so well that health professionals will now administer them to every patient in DRC. “From now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable,” Dr. Muyembe said. “It’s the first example that a therapeutic intervention can have a dramatic effect on decreasing the mortality of the Ebola virus disease,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The two antibody-based treatments, REGN-EB3 and mAb-114, work by blocking a critical protein in the Ebola virus. Patients receive them once, intravenously, and “ideally, as soon as possible” after infection, Fauci said. **They saved about 90 percent of patients with low levels of infection, according to preliminary data released from the trial.** Across all levels of infection, patients who received REGN-EB3 had a mortality rate of 29 percent, while those treated with mAb-114 had a mortality rate of 34 percent. The average mortality rate for Ebola has been about 50 percent, according to the World health Organization (WHO).

Some angry residents were protesting the arrival of a response team at a clinic where a woman who came from Kiwanja in Rutshuru territory died. A resident who was at the site testified that "young people barricaded the road from the three-lantern entrance to Majengo before reaching Buhene. They attack any Land Cruiser vehicle thinking they have teams on board. They say that Ebola is a business imported from Beni-Butembo to Goma." "I heard a few shots," the same source added. These protests come as two Ebola cases have been declared cured and have left the Ebola treatment center in Goma.

Last week, Rwandan and DRC citizens living in Gisenyi either experienced difficulties or were prevented from entering Rwanda or the DRC. On August 11, a Beninese resident in Goma, an international civil servant in an organization active in North Kivu province, was prevented from entering Rwanda where he was driving his children for health care, and hundreds of travelers also suffered the same fate. Part of WHO’s recommendations after declaring the current outbreak an emergency of international concern was for national authorities of border states to avoid using this declaration to hinder regional migratory movements.

_Reliefweb, 8/9/19_

Mark Lowcock, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, announced a US$10 million CERF contribution on August 9. The funds will be used to strengthen early detection of the disease, reinforce prevention and infection control measures, provide psychosocial and nutritional support to affected people, and bolster engagement with communities. The $10 million allocation is in addition to $4.8 million allocated by CERF to UN agencies to respond to the outbreaks in Equateur and North Kivu provinces last year, and a separate $10 million contributed for Ebola response readiness in border countries.

Not "curable", but rather "treatable with a specific drug". Best mAb cocktail from @Regeneron with a 29% CFR in treated group (overall for the outbreak \~70%). This is promising news for #Ebola treatments!

2\. Even if growth of the #Ebola outbreak explains the rise in orphaned & separated kids, it's a flat out awful situation. @UNICEF reports that 1380 kids have been orphaned (lost 1 or both parents) & 2469 have been separated from parents — hopefully in most cases temporarily.

Getting funds to #health workers on the front lines is critical to ending the #Ebola outbreak. Read this new blog by @WorldBank Group Pres. @DavidMalpassWBG:
