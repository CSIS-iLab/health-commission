Scott Kirby has been one of the most proactive chief executives on public health during the Covid-19 pandemic. In August 2021, United Airlines announced a vaccine requirement for all employees, the first major aircraft carrier to do so. Within eight weeks, 99.7 percent of United employees were vaccinated. As Covid-19 related restrictions begin to ease, the travel industry will have to confront a new set of challenges, including a tight labor market, an evolving workplace culture, and geopolitical conflict, all while ensuring the health and safety of employees and customers.
