The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the provision of essential health services worldwide, including routine immunizations. Yet strengthening immunization programs depends not only on vaccine supply, but also on the development of sustainable, community-driven health systems with primary care at the center. Activities that support the provision of primary health care and immunization services, including data collection, technical assistance, and financing face new challenges in the context of Covid-19, as well.

Please join the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security on **Monday, June 28th,** from **2:00p.m. – 2:45p.m. EDT** for the second in a series of conversations examining how strong, community-based primary health care services can support vaccine distribution and how, at the same time, immunization programs can help promote access to primary health care services.

This expert panel will feature **John Borrazzo**, Senior Health Specialist at the Global Financing Facility (GFF) Secretariat; **Hannah Ratcliffe,** Assistant Director of Research on the Primary Health Care team at Ariadne Labs; and **Lora Shimp**, Director of the Immunization Center, International at JSI, and the conversation will be moderated by **Katherine E. Bliss**, Senior Fellow with the CSIS Global Health Policy Center.
