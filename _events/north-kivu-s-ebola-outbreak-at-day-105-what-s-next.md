The Ebola outbreak unfolding in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most recent, powerful showcase of what it means to battle dangerous health security threats in a disordered world. WHO leadership is critically important to ongoing Ebola response efforts. The week of November 5, Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response, traveled on a delegation to the epicenter of the outbreak in the DRC with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix to examine the state of outbreak response, including the security environment, community mobilization, strengthening programmatic response, and what additional action needs to be taken to contain the crisis.

On Wednesday, November 14, 2018, from 9:00 to 11:00 am. the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America's Health Security and the CSIS Africa Program co-hosted a panel discussion on the Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC. The discussion followed the publication of a new [Commission Issue Brief](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/articles/north-kivu-s-ebola-outbreak-at-day-90-what-is-to-be-done/) on the crisis. Panelists included: Dr. Salama; Mitch Wolfe, CDC Chief Medical Officer and Acting Director of the CDC Washington Office; Tim Ziemer, USAID Acting Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance; and Judd Devermont, CSIS Africa Program Director. Commission Secretariat Director and CSIS Senior Vice President and Global Health Policy Center Director J. Stephen Morrison moderated the discussion, which examined impressive progress and dangerous gaps in the outbreak response, including insecurity, upcoming elections, the role of the Ebola vaccine, and community mistrust, and deliberated recommendations for U.S. and global leaders.
