Please join the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security on **Wednesday, May 18, from 3:30-4:30pm ET,** for an important virtual event to examine the outcomes of the Second Global Covid-19 Summit. The panel will feature a senior representative from the Biden Administration and CSIS Commission co-chairs **Julie Gerberding**, CEO of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, and **Susan Brooks**, former U.S. Representative (IN-05). The discussion will be moderated by GHPC Director **J. Stephen Morrison**.

The Second Global Covid-19 Summit, scheduled for May 12, will be co-hosted by the United States and international partners representing regional and multilateral bodies: Belize, as CARICOM Chair; Germany, holding the G7 Presidency; Indonesia, holding the G20 Presidency; and Senegal as African Union Chair. The Summit marks a critical moment to reinvigorate multilateral support for the global Covid response as political and financial attention dwindles. The panel discussion will focus on the outcomes of the Summit, including the commitments that are brought forward, opportunities and gaps, and whether the Summit will help renew a multilateral pandemic response.
