Please join the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening Americaâ€™s Health Security ](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/)on Tuesday, January 11, from 3:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. ET, for a fireside chat with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. J. Stephen Morrison, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, will join Dr. Fauci in a conversation centered on the question: what might Omicron mean in the larger picture of the pandemic and the future, at home and abroad? Are accumulating immune protections driving fundamental changes in the virus that, once the Omicron blizzard has passed, open the possibility of heightened resilience and more reliable and effective management of the virus? Or, despite the impact of expanded global immunity, do deep vulnerabilities and risks persist for much of the world, including the unforeseen challenges that future variants may pose? Will Omicron be a wake-up call to leaders to enact solutions that are scaled to what is truly needed globally, or will it fuel complacency and inwardness?
