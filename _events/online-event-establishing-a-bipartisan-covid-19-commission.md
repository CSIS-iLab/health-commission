On May 1, 2020, CSIS’s International Security Program and Global Health Policy Center hosted a bipartisan event with Representatives Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and John Katko (R-NY) highlighting their efforts to establish a bipartisan commission to examine the Covid-19 crisis. Dr. Kathleen Hicks, Senior Vice President, Henry A. Kissinger Chair, and Director of the International Security Program at CSIS hosted a discussion with Representatives Murphy and Katko from 11:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.

This was followed by a panel discussion with Dr. Julie Louise Gerberding, Executive Vice President and Chief Patient Officer, Merck & Co., Inc; Suerie Moon, Co-Director of the Global Health Centre and Visiting Lecturer for Interdisciplinary Programs at the Graduate Institute Geneva; and Christine Wormuth, Director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation; led by J. Stephen Morrison, Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Health Policy Center at CSIS, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen. The spread of the pandemic in the war-torn country threatens to be the most catastrophic in the world. Yemen’s healthcare system has collapsed, over 3.6 million Yemenis are internally displaced, and 24 million Yemenis—85 percent of the population—are in need of humanitarian aid.

On April 27, 2020, CSIS held a virtual discussion of the implications of COVID-19 in Yemen with **Lise Grande**, UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. The event was co-hosted by the CSIS Middle East Program, Global Health Policy Center, and Humanitarian Agenda. The event featured CSIS experts **Jon B. Alterman**, Senior Vice President, Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, and Director of the Middle East Program, and **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Health Policy Center.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItMMk5uqFZc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
