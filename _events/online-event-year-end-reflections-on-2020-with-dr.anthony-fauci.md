On December 14, 2020, the [_CSIS Commission on Strengthening Americaâ€™s Health Security_](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) hosted a conversation with **_Dr. Anthony Fauci_**, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Moderated by **_J. Stephen Morrison_**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, **_Dr. Anthony Fauci_** offered his personal reflections on 2020, a year unlike any other. Amid good and bad outcomes, revelations and stumbles, what was learned as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded? As the pandemic surges, the year concludes amid huge losses, a deeply divided nation, a new administration and Congress, and rising hope as promising vaccines are introduced. How is the country to navigate these currents? How is a durable national consensus to be forged?
