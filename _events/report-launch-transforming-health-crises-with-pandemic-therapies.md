Nearly three years into the global Covid-19 pandemic, vaccines, tests, and therapies have made the work of preventing, diagnosing, and treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, much easier. Unprecedented collaboration in research and development has resulted in the availability and emergency use authorization or approval of new vaccines in record time. However, with Covid-19 vaccine and booster coverage in many low- and middle-income countries far below global targets, tests and therapies remain critical tools to reduce transmission of the virus among susceptible populations and prevent a surge in hospitalizations that could rapidly overwhelm fragile health systems.

A new report by **Katherine E. Bliss**, Senior Fellow and Director of Immunizations and Health Systems Resilience at the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, and **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, discusses key challenges and recommendations aimed at strengthening U.S. leadership and global action to ensure development of, access to, and uptake of Covid-19 therapies worldwide. Please join the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security on **Thursday, November 10**, from 3:30 to 4:30pm ET for a panel discussion on the report’s recommendations featuring **Dr. Nahid Bhadelia,** Senior Policy Advisor for Global Covid-19 Response at the White House Covid-19 Response Team, **Gary Edson,** President of COVID Collaborative and former Deputy National Security Advisor, and **Jenelle Krishnamoorthy**, Vice President and Head of Global Public Policy and International Affairs at Merck.
