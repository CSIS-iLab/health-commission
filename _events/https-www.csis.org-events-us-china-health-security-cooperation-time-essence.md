Although the United States and China have entered a period of strategic competition, bilateral cooperation on health security is of paramount importance. A new [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-us-china-health-security-cooperation-era-strategic-competition) from the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security – authored by **Yanzhong Huang**, Senior Fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, and **Scott Kennedy**, CSIS Senior Adviser and Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics – lays out six concrete, actionable streams for collaboration.

Please join the CSIS Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics and CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security for a discussion on the key takeaways of the report. Panelists will include **Xiaoqing Boynton**, Senior Director of International Affairs at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization; **Tom Frieden**, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives; **Deborah Seligsohn**, Senior Associate with the CSIS Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics and Assistant Professor of Political Science at Villanova University. Scott Kennedy will provide a background of the report and Yanzhong Huang will provide a summary of the report’s policy recommendations, respectively. **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, will host and moderate the discussion.
