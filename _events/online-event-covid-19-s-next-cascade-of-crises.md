On July 22, the Commission hosted a public discussion with **_Mark Lowcock_**_,_ Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, along with **_Congresswoman Susan Brooks_** (R-IN-05) and **_Congressman Ami Bera_** (D-CA-07). **_Dr. Julie Gerberding_**_,_ Executive Vice President and Chief Patient Officer at Merck and Commission Co-Chair, moderated the discussion.

On July 17, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released an updated [_Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19_](https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/GHRP-COVID19_July_update.pdf), an effort to direct attention and resources to the insufficient response to Covid-19 globally, especially in humanitarian settings. The Plan outlines how without early coordinated intervention, we will see a drastic deterioration in humanitarian conditions, economic prosperity, and civil stability in fragile states. The Panel discussed the cost of inaction at this critical moment, implications for U.S. leadership, and how U.S. interests could be harmed without more decisive support and engagement.

**_Dr. Julie Gerberding_** moderated a discussion between panelists on how the United States, and particularly the U.S. Congress, can act to stem the global spread of Covid-19, avert catastrophic outcomes for the world’s most vulnerable, and mitigate heightened disorder across multiple regions.
