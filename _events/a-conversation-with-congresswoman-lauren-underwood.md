On **Friday, May 7 from 10:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m. EDT,** the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) hosted a timely conversation with **Congresswoman Lauren Underwood** (D-IL-14). The _American Rescue Plan Act_ has ushered in a new phase in the national Covid-19 response. A majority of the adult population in the United States has received at least one dose of the vaccine, resulting in declining daily death counts. Control of the virus, however, remains elusive and many communities continue to experience high caseloads. Abroad, the United States faces a vaccine marketplace in disarray. Low- and middle-income countries struggle to secure doses and remain susceptible to uncontrolled transmission. A rapid, equitable and global recovery is at risk.

What key lessons have the U.S. Congress and American public learned from the pandemic? Does the _American Rescue Plan Act_ set the stage for sustainable, increased investment in federal and state public health infrastructure? What additional steps should be taken to address systemic public health disparities across key populations? And what role should Congress play in directing U.S. engagement on global health security, including global vaccination campaigns, genomic sequencing, and disease surveillance?

**_J. Stephen Morrison_**_,_ Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, discussed these pressing issues with **_Congresswoman Lauren Underwood_**_,_ Member of the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security, House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and Co-Chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus.
