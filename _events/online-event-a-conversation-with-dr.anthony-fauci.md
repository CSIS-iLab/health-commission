On July 24, **_J. Stephen Morrison_** interviewed **_Dr. Anthony Fauci_**, Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on Covid-19 in the United States. The United States is in the midst of a worsening crisis, with Covid-19 cases and deaths increasing in the Sun Belt, the West, and many other parts of the United States. This begs the question: what is the strategy for ensuring that the outbreak does not spiral out of control in the United States? How can the United States strengthen the basic public health capacities – test, trace, and isolate – needed to slow the spread? What federal, state, and local actions may be necessary to protect the American people and safely reopen businesses, schools, and sporting events?

**_J. Stephen Morrison_**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, discussed these difficult questions with **_Dr. Anthony Fauci_**. They also discussed the development of a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine, including the status and promise of Operation Warp Speed.
