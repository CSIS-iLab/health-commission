On **Thursday, November 5**, the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/final-report/) hosted a conversation with **_Dr. Rajiv J. Shah_**, President of The Rockefeller Foundation, on the Foundation’s recent [announcement](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-commits-usd1-billion-to-catalyze-a-green-recovery-from-pandemic/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=Philanthropy&utm_content=PR_ReimagineFuture) of a $1 billion investment that will primarily focus on increasing healthcare access in the U.S. and globally to end the pandemic and driving historic public-private investment that expands renewable energy across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. **_J. Stephen Morrison_**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, and **_Sarah Ladislaw_**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Energy Security and Climate Change Program, joined with Dr. Shah in a discussion of the Foundation’s strategy of catalyzing a more inclusive, climate-friendly recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Foundation’s one-time, billion-dollar commitment aims to catalyze billions of dollars in private and concessional investments that will scale distributed renewable energy for the more than 800 million people stuck in energy poverty in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and ensure more equitable access to Covid-19 tests and vaccines, science-based tools, and data to fight the pandemic, while strengthening public health systems to prevent future outbreaks.
