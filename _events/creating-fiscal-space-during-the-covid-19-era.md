On **Thursday, April 29 from 2:00 – 3:30 p.m. EDT**, the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) and CSIS Economics Program co-hosted a panel discussion on the major findings of a new Commission report: _Creating Fiscal Space in the Covid-19 Era_. This event featured keynote remarks followed by a distinguished panel of experts, who discussed innovative, concrete options for generating financial resources for pandemic preparedness and response in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The Covid-19 pandemic is a call to action to rethink the roles of official and private sectors in financing pandemic preparedness and response in LMICs with fragile public health systems. The discussion will explore the potential for new approaches to create space for essential investments, leveraging international finance institutions, addressing debt sustainability, and mobilizing new resources to sustain investment in global public health.

**J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, will introduced the Commission’s work and welcomed keynote remarks from **Andy Baukol**, who is performing the duties of the Under Secretary for International Affairs at the U.S. Department of Treasury.­­­­­ **_Stephanie Segal_**_,_ Senior Fellow with the CSIS Economics Program, will then moderate a panel discussion with **Mark Bowman**, Director General, International Finance at HM Treasury, **Gargee Ghosh**, President of Global Policy and Advocacy at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, **Nancy Lee**, Senior Policy Fellow at the Center for Global Development and Senior Advisor at CSIS, and **Nathan Sheets**, Chief Economist and Head of Global Macroeconomic Research at PGIM Fixed Income.
