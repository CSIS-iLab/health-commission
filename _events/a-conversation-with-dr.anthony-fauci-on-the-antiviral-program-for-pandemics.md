On **Tuesday, August 3rd from 2:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m. EDT,** the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) will host a fireside chat with **Dr. Anthony Fauci**, Chief Medical Advisor to the President and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Moderated by **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, the discussion will examine the administration’s signature initiative, [The Antiviral Program for Pandemics](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/antivirals), which dedicates $3.2 billion to speed development of antivirals for COVID-19 and other viruses with the potential to become pandemics.

Expanding the repertoire of widely available, effective drug therapies for COVID-19 is critical for minimizing the impact of the pandemic as countries contend with emerging variants and incomplete vaccine rollouts. Dr. Fauci will discuss the genesis, goals and structure of this landmark investment, the place which key partnerships occupy in the vision, and how the initiative relates to other international efforts to accelerate the research, development and deployment of new therapies.
