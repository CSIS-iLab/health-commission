Please join the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) on **Wednesday, June 23 from 5:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m. EDT** for a conversation on the future of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). As it nears the end of its very successful first five-year cycle, CEPI aims to expand its role in the Covid-19 era based on a [recently released](https://cepi.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CEPI-2.0_Strategy-2022-26-Mar21.pdf) $3.5 billion investment case for years 2022 - 2026, which sets forth a new vision for accelerating the development of vaccines, expanding global vaccine and therapeutic manufacturing capacities, and strengthening the design of preparedness and response institutions. At the heart of the CEPI 2.0 strategy is an effort to establish a post-pandemic consensus that drives collective action for reducing global epidemic and pandemic risk. An evolving partnership with the United States will be an essential element into the future.

Join **_J. Stephen Morrison_**_,_ Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, in a conversation with **Richard Hatchett,** Chief Executive Officer of CEPI, and **Julie Gerberding**, Co-chair of the CSIS Commission and Executive Vice President and Chief Patient Officer of Merck & Co. Inc.
