As the world passes one year of the coronavirus pandemic, multiple vaccine candidates have completed phase III trials, been approved, and are being prepared for global delivery. But amid what promises to be an unprecedented global introduction effort, countries are still working to restore routine immunization services and campaigns that had been [disrupted](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-research-and-planning-equitable-distribution-covid-19-vaccine) or suspended earlier in the pandemic, leaving many children at [risk](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/covid-19-massive-impact-lower-income-countries-threatens-more-disease-outbreaks) of other outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite evidence of the [value](http://immunizationeconomics.org/recent-activity/2020/8/7/bca-weighs-routine-vaccination-against-covid-19) of routine immunization services, health professionals continue to grapple with the diversion of resources to the Covid-19 response, rising [costs](http://immunizationeconomics.org/recent-activity/2020/7/23/covid-19-increases-cost-to-deliver-immunization), the slowdown of supply chains, and community fear and mistrust. To what extent has the pandemic affected country experiences with routine vaccination? And what are the prospects for revitalizing progress on routine immunization coverage for deadly diseases such as [measles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03043-4) under emergency circumstances while preparing for the introduction of Covid-19 vaccines?
