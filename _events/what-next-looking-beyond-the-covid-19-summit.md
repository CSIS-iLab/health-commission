Please join the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) on **Tuesday, October 12, from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. EDT,** for an important virtual event featuring **Peter Sands**, Executive Director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; **Loyce Pace,** Director of the Office of Global Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and **Julie Gerberding,** Executive Vice President and Chief Patient Officer at Merck & Co., Inc., to discuss how to advance the global Covid-19 response in the wake of President Biden’s September 22 Summit and leading up to the G20. The discussion will be moderated by GHPC Director **J. Stephen Morrison**.

The U.S. Summit was an important step toward re-energizing global action against Covid-19, but it left several unanswered questions regarding how the world will realistically hit the targets laid out in the Biden administration’s response framework for the next year and beyond. Urgent action is needed to advance several immediate priorities, such as the design and launch of a pandemic financing fund and strengthening country delivery capacity, but it remains unclear which actors will lead and how countries will be held accountable for their commitments. In the work ahead, decision making related to the global response will also need to include a broader tent of players, including China, low- and middle-income country leadership, and private sector entities who were underrepresented at the Summit. The G20 Summit in late October presents the next opportunity to address these outstanding questions. And as the world faces the prospect of a drawn-out response to Covid-19, it will be critical to consider how to sustain high-level political and financial interest, as well as how existing institutions including the Global Fund, World Bank, and others may align with new mechanisms for pandemic preparedness and response.
