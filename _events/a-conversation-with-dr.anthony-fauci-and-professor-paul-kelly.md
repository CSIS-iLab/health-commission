On **Tuesday, March 9, 2021** the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) and the [Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security](https://indopacifichealthsecurity.dfat.gov.au/) co-hosted a discussion with **Dr. Anthony Fauci**, Chief Medical Advisor to the President and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and **Professor Paul Kelly**, Chief Medical Officer at the Australian Government Department of Health. Moderated by **Katherine E. Bliss**, Senior Fellow with the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, the discussion examined how the Australian and United States governments are recalibrating their public health strategies in response to SARS-CoV-2 variants, which have fundamentally changed the trajectory of the pandemic.

The proliferation of variants threatens to curtail vaccine efficacy and generate an endemic, recurrent pandemic. Prospects for reaching a single pivot moment, in which herd immunity is achieved and public health controls are loosened, appear to have faded. Panelists will consider how to communicate this complicated set of new realities to a weary public, as well as the most promising areas of health security collaboration between the United States and Australia.
