Please join the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security ](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/members/ "https://healthsecurity.csis.org/members/")on **Thursday, October 7, from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.** EDT, for an exciting virtual event featuring **Lawrence O. Gostin**, University Professor and Director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, and author of the newly released [_Global Health Security: A Blueprint for the Future_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976610&content=bios "https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976610&content=bios"). The discussion will be moderated by **J. Stephen Morrison**, CSIS Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Health Policy Center and **H. Andrew Schwartz**, CSIS Chief Communications Officer.

The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed how weak governance, weak health systems, and a lack of preparedness are critical sources of risk in the face of borderless, unpredictable threats including infectious disease and bioterrorism —even in wealthy countries such as the United States. In _Global Health Security,_ Gostin argues that health security is broader than just national health policy, as pandemic threats are exacerbated by political, environmental, and socioeconomic factors within and among states. Achieving stronger global health security – and being prepared for future emergencies – will require sustained investments, early detection and warning, robust international institutions armed with tools for effective cross-border cooperation, and a commitment to shared values of collective responsibility and equity.
