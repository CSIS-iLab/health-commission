The Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the threat infectious diseases pose to economic growth, social programs, and political stability, as well as global security. Yet prior to the emergence of Covid-19, global health experts had encouraged a [greater focus](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/final-report/) on pandemic preparedness, noting the roles conflict, poverty, urbanization, climate change, and even anti-science sentiments play in undermining the progress made in addressing vaccine-preventable diseases and anticipating the emergence of new ones. The response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized both by heightened nationalism and protectionism, along with unprecedented cooperation on science and vaccine research and development. As global Covid-19 immunization efforts accelerate, and equitable access to vaccines becomes central to global recovery, what opportunities are there to re-energize international diplomatic engagement on global health security and pandemic preparedness?

**On May 12, 2021**, the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) hosted a conversation with **Peter J. Hotez**, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, moderated by **Katherine E. Bliss**, Senior Fellow with the CSIS Global Health Policy Center. Dr. Hotez discussed his new book, [_Preventing the Next Pandemic: Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti-science_](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/preventing-next-pandemic), and how, as leaders begin to turn their attention to the future, renewed international partnerships rooted in scientific cooperation could help better prepare us for the next crisis.
