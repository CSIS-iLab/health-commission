excerpt: |-
  Please join the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security on Thursday, October 1 from 9:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. EDT for a conversation with U.S. Congressman Tom Cole (R-OK-4). The United States continues to struggle to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, in the face of persistent outbreaks and significant death tolls impeding a return to normalcy.

  How to improve the accessibility and utility of Covid-19 testing across states and local municipalities? What steps should Congress advocate to address social disparities in Covid-19 caseloads, particularly in Native American, Black, and Latinx communities? How to assess Operation Warp Speed’s progress towards a Covid-19 vaccine while at the same time reversing declines in the public’s trust and confidence in vaccines?  How is the United States to lead in addressing the vaccine needs of low- and middle-income countries?  And what are key lessons for the U.S. Congress regarding pandemic preparedness, at home and abroad, generated by the Covid-19 pandemic? Including steps to strengthen the CDC and WHO?

  Please join J. Stephen Morrison, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, as he discusses these questions with U.S. Congressman Tom Cole, Member of the CSIS Commission and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.

  This event is made possible by the generous support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
