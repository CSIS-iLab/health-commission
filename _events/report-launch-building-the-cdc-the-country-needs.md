The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has entered a moment of peril. Long heralded a national public health asset, CDC has suffered a sharp decline in popular trust and confidence, a signal of widespread concern over its performance in preventing and responding, at home and abroad, to dangerous outbreaks. The United States needs a strong, effective, and more accountable national public health agency to protect the health of all Americans and ensure the stability of the broader world.

The [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/ "Commission Microsite") released [_Building the CDC the Country Needs,_](https://www.csis.org/events/report-launch-building-cdc-country-needs "Report Webpage") a detailed report with actionable recommendations for CDC’s performance in preventing and responding to dangerous outbreaks. The report was developed by a bipartisan working group cochaired by **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, and **Tom Inglesby**, Director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Please join the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security on **Tuesday, January 17** **from 11:30am to 1:00pm ET** **at the CSIS offices or online** for a lively roundtable discussion on the report’s recommendations featuring the authors of the report—**J. Stephen Morrison** and **Tom Inglesby**—and other panelists to be announced.
