How should we assess progress in the national vaccination campaign? What should Americans expect heading into the fall? Has emergency funding for pandemic response succeeded in strengthening America’s public health capacities? The Biden administration’s FY 2022 budget includes $1 billion for global health security—how can this be best applied?
