On **Wednesday, December 9 from 12:00 p.m. - 1:00 p.m. EST,** the [_CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security _](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/)hosted a conversation with **_Anders Tegnell_**, State Epidemiologist of the Public Health Agency of Sweden. Sweden’s national response to Covid-19 has been notably restrained. The Swedish government has emphasized public trust and individual responsibility, while eschewing national lockdowns and mask mandates. Schools, restaurants, and local businesses have remained open. But as the winter surge unfolds, as mortality rates have risen and economic impacts have become more pronounced, its approach is shifting, subject to closer scrutiny and public debate. In this CSIS public event, **_J. Stephen Morrison_**, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, joined with **_Anders Tegnell_** in discussing Sweden’s evolving response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including lessons learned from 2020 and what lies ahead in 2021.

_This event was made possible by the generous support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation_.
