The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the provision of essential health services worldwide, including routine immunizations. Strong, community-focused primary health care programs have proven instrumental in maintaining services for non-communicable diseases, delivering maternal and newborn health care, and sustaining vaccination programs over the past eighteen months. During this period, Costa Rica has emerged as a model of how long-term investments in primary health care not only strengthen the population’s access to affordable, community-based health services but also support pandemic response.
