The spread of Covid-19 continues to dominate global attention. Governments are primarily focusing efforts on the domestic response to the virus. With 168 million people in need of humanitarian assistance globally, including 70 million forcibly displaced, understanding how the pandemic will impact the most vulnerable is vital to implementing an effective response. In this series, the CSIS Humanitarian Agenda speaks with leadership across humanitarian institutions about the challenges their organizations face during Covid-19.

Jacob Kurtzer, Interim Director and Senior Fellow, CSIS Humanitarian Agenda, and J. Stephen Morrison, Senior Vice President and Director, CSIS Global Health Policy Center, hosted host Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to discuss how the ICRC is adapting and responding to the pandemic. The discussion focused on the ICRCâ€™s efforts to promote adherence to international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles, and explore the adaptations necessary to respond to humanitarian needs during a global pandemic.
