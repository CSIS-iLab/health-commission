Cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen. The spread of the pandemic in the war-torn country threatens to be the most catastrophic in the world. Yemen’s healthcare system has collapsed, over 3.6 million Yemenis are internally displaced, and 24 million Yemenis—85 percent of the population—are in need of humanitarian aid.

On April 27, 2020, CSIS held a virtual discussion of the implications of COVID-19 in Yemen with **Lise Grande**, UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. The event was co-hosted by the CSIS Middle East Program, Global Health Policy Center, and Humanitarian Agenda. The event featured CSIS experts **Jon B. Alterman**, Senior Vice President, Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, and Director of the Middle East Program, and **J. Stephen Morrison**, Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Health Policy Center.
