Please join the [CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security](https://healthsecurity.csis.org/) on **Monday, December 20, from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET,** for an important virtual event featuring **Paul Spiegel**, Professor and Director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and **Leonard Rubenstein,** Professor and Director of the Program on Human Rights and Health in Conflict at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. **J. Stephen Morrison**, CSIS Senior Vice President and Global Health Policy Center Director, will host and moderate a discussion on the state of the healthcare system in Afghanistan. Paul Spiegel joins us after returning from a five-week stint as Acting Incident Manager at the World Health Organization operational center in Kabul.

The Afghan healthcare system is buckling under a slew of political, economic, and humanitarian crises. Six simultaneous disease outbreaks—cholera, measles, polio, malaria, dengue fever, and Covid-19—threaten the population as basic medical supplies dwindle and healthcare workers’ salaries stall. As the winter approaches, it is critical to recognize the [situation on the ground](https://www.csis.org/analysis/pulling-afghanistan-back-precipice-without-capitulation); assess the political, human, and technical limitations faced by the humanitarian and health sectors; and consider the evolving choices to sustain health programs and capacities.
