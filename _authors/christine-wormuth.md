Prior to joining RAND, she was director of the Adrienne Arsht Center for Resilience, which was established at the Atlantic Council in 2017 to advance approaches that promote the abilities of nations, cities, communities, and individuals to respond and adapt effectively to disruptions emerging from todayâ€™s unpredictable global environment.  
  
Ms. Wormuth was Under-Secretary of Defense for Policy (USDP) at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) from 2014 to 2016. In that role, she advised both Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary Ash Carter on the full range of regional and functional national security issues. As USDP she frequently represented DoD at the White House and spent considerable time on the counter-ISIS campaign, the rebalance to Asia, counterterrorism operations, and US defense relations with countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.    
  
From 2012 to 2014, Ms. Wormuth was deputy under-secretary of defense for strategy, plans, and forces, and led the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. She served as special assistant to the president and senior director for defense at the National Security Council (NSC) from December 2010 until August 2012, where she was the primary liaison from NSC to the Pentagon on defense issues. She started in the Obama Administration as principal deputy assistant secretary for homeland defense.   
  
Before joining the Obama Administration, Ms. Wormuth spent five years at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) as a senior fellow, writing and speaking extensively on defense and homeland security issues.
