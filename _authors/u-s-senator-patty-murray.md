**Senator Patty Murray** is the senior Senator from the state of Washington. Serving as a member of Senate Democratic leadership since 2007, Senator Murray has established herself as a tireless and effective leader on education, transportation, budget issues, port security, healthcare, women, and veterans’ issues.  
  
Senator Murray is currently Assistant Democratic Leader, the third-ranking Democrat in the United States Senate. She is the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, and a senior member of both the Appropriations and Veterans Affairs Committees.  
  
Over the last few years, she has been one of the few members of Congress able to break through the partisanship and gridlock. After the government shutdown in 2013, she worked to restore investments in education, health care, and jobs, and by bringing Democrats and Republicans together in 2015, she worked to pass a law that finally replaced the broken No Child Left Behind law.  
  
As a member of the Commission, Senator Murray is interested in addressing antimicrobial resistance, pandemic threats, and women’s health issues. She is also focused on making sure policy solutions account for how global health security impacts families and communities and how global health threats are also countless personal tragedies.   
  
Senator Murray began her public service career in the 1980s by serving on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988 was elected to the Washington State Senate. In 1992, she ran for the United States Senate as a voice for Washington families who were not being heard. Dramatically outspent, Senator Murray ran a grassroots campaign of family, friends, supporters, and public interest groups to beat a 10-year veteran of the U.S. House of Representatives.
