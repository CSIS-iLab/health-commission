**Rocco Casagrande** began his public-sector career as a U.N. weapons inspector in pre-war Iraq where he led the U.N.'s biological analysis laboratories. Today, as a founder and Managing Partner of Gryphon Scientific, he is a widely respected thought leader on defense against weapons of mass destruction and managing the safety and security risks of cutting-edge biological research and commercial biotechnologies. Over the past 20 years, Dr. Casagrande has led more than 50 projects on assessing the threat posed by use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, understanding vulnerabilities exploited by these attacks, and devising mechanisms to prevent such attacks or improve the response to these attacks. Much of his work involves the science behind the misuse of dangerous pathogens to create biological weapons.  
  
A life scientist, with a degree from Cornell in biology and chemistry and an MIT Ph.D. in biology, Dr. Casagrande has a particular interest in the benefits and risks of emerging biotechnologies–innovations that may have transformative effects on life sciences but raise considerable challenges for policy and governance. In one project, Dr. Casagrande and his team studied how to minimize the risk of misuse of synthetic DNA to create pathogens. This study became the basis for the government’s framework for responsibly conducting critical studies in this field. Dr. Casagrande has also lead studies in the risks of outsourcing in the biotechnology industry and the safety/security risks associated with research at the first ever laboratory in the US that will study the most dangerous zoonotic diseases (those that infect both humans and lower animals) in large animals.
