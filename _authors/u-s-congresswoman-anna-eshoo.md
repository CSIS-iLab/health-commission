**Congresswoman Anna Eshoo** is the current representative from California’s 18th district. For over two decades in Congress, she has defended consumers, promoted American competitiveness and innovation, fought for access to health care for families and children, protected the environment, and encouraged development of clean energy technology. Congresswoman Eshoo was first sworn in as a Member of the United States House of Representatives in January 1993, after serving on the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors for 10 years.  
  
As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a member of the Health Subcommittee, Congresswoman Eshoo helped draft portions of the Affordable Care Act to provide comprehensive, affordable health insurance for all Americans, and she continues to work on strengthening the law. She has written landmark bipartisan legislation to promote the development of new lifesaving cures in biologic drugs; protect patient’s genetic information from being used to discriminate against them; modernize how the Food and Drug Administration regulates and approves medical devices; and promote the development of drugs specifically for children.  
  
Congresswoman Eshoo served on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for 10 years, chairing the Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management. She has authored legislation to protect our national security and our civil liberties, improve Congressional oversight of the intelligence community, prevent conflicts of interest, and better meet the domestic and international security challenges of the 21st Century. She also authored the original Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act and subsequent reauthorizations to strengthen and improve our nation’s disaster preparedness and biodefense programs.
