**Ambassador Mark Dybul** is the faculty director of the Center for Global Health and Quality at the Georgetown University Medical Center, which seeks to work with international partners to respond to pressing global health challenges. A well-recognized global health expert and humanitarian, Dybul most recently served as executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.  
  
Dybul served as a HIV research fellow at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under director Dr. Anthony Fauci in the late 1990s. He conducted basic and clinical HIV research at NIAID, and eventually conducted the first randomized, controlled trial with combination antiretroviral therapy with HIV patients in Africa.    
  
The Georgetown alumnus went on to lead President George W. Bush’s International Prevention of Mother and Child HIV initiative for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and in 2006 was named U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. As U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, he led the implementation of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a health initiative Dybul helped create. He later became the inaugural Global Health Fellow of the George W. Bush Institute.
