    "Short Bio": "Katherine E. Bliss is Senior Fellow with the CSIS Global Health Policy Center. She brings her expertise in the social sciences, Latin American studies, and international relations to her work analyzing U.S. government support for health programs in low- and middle-income countries.

    "Long Bio": "Katherine E. Bliss brings her expertise in the social sciences, Latin American studies, and international relations to her work analyzing U.S. government support for health programs in low- and middle-income countries. She is particularly interested in how political and cultural perspectives shape approaches to such global health challenges as HIV/AIDS; vaccine-preventable diseases; and access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Trained as a historian, Katherine spent the early part of her career teaching at the university level and publishing books and articles on gender relations and public health in twentieth-century Mexico. A Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs Fellowship enabled her to shift her focus to global health policy, placing her at the U.S. Department of State, where she worked on environmental health issues and the development of foreign policy approaches to pandemic preparedness.\n\nAt CSIS, Katherine has previously served as deputy director and senior fellow within both the Americas Program and Global Health Policy Center, where she oversaw a multi-program project on the influence of the BRICS countries on the global health agenda and directed the Project on Global Water Policy. Her recent work has examined the health situation in the context of the Venezuelan political crisis and the challenges facing immunization programs within fragile or disordered settings. Katherine received her A.B. in history and literature, magna cum laude, from Harvard College and her Ph.D. in history from the University of Chicago. She completed a David E. Bell Fellowship at the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies.\n"

    "Long Bio": "Rocco Casagrande began his public-sector career as a U.N. weapons inspector in pre-war Iraq where he led the U.N.'s biological analysis laboratories. Today, as a founder and Managing Partner of Gryphon Scientific, he is a widely respected thought leader on defense against weapons of mass destruction and managing the safety and security risks of cutting-edge biological research and commercial biotechnologies. Over the past 20 years, Dr. Casagrande has led more than 50 projects on assessing the threat posed by use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons, understanding vulnerabilities exploited by these attacks, and devising mechanisms to prevent such attacks or improve the response to these attacks. Much of his work involves the science behind the misuse of dangerous pathogens to create biological weapons.\n\nA life scientist, with a degree from Cornell in biology and chemistry and an MIT Ph.D. in biology, Dr. Casagrande has a particular interest in the benefits and risks of emerging biotechnologies–innovations that may have transformative effects on life sciences but raise considerable challenges for policy and governance. In one project, Dr. Casagrande and his team studied how to minimize the risk of misuse of synthetic DNA to create pathogens. This study became the basis for the government’s framework for responsibly conducting critical studies in this field. Dr. Casagrande has also lead studies in the risks of outsourcing in the biotechnology industry and the safety/security risks associated with research at the first ever laboratory in the US that will study the most dangerous zoonotic diseases (those that infect both humans and lower animals) in large animals."
