  About the Commission: The CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security
    aims to chart a bold vision for the future of U.S. leadership in global health
    security, at home and abroad. Recent events demonstrate the growing linkages between
    global health challenges and U.S. national security interests – between what touches
    Americans directly in their communities and what touches them indirectly from
    outside U.S. borders. We see an emerging recognition of the need for a stronger,
    more coherent, better integrated, and more reliably sustained U.S. approach to
    health security. The Commission offers the opportunity to build a pragmatic, actionable
    consensus. The Commission brings together a distinguished and diverse group of
    senior leaders who bridge the health and security fields, comprising members of
    Congress, past administrations, industry, foundations, universities, and NGOs.
    This is a two-year effort organized by the CSIS Global Health Policy Center.

  About: 'The CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security is a two-year
    effort organized by the CSIS Global Health Policy Center. The Commission brings
    together a distinguished and diverse group of high-level opinion leaders who bridge
    security and health, comprising members of Congress, past administrations, industry,
    foundations, universities, and NGOs, and the Commission is advised by a group
    of preeminent subject experts. The Commission’s core aim is to chart a bold vision
    for the future of U.S. leadership in global health security – at home and abroad.  In
    recent years, U.S. senior policymakers have shown greater appreciation of the
    growing importance of health security to U.S. national interests and of the need
    for a stronger, more coherent, integrated, better resourced and more reliably
    sustained U.S. approach. Multiple threats fall under a health security umbrella:
    risk of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease epidemics; rapid spread of
    drug-resistant infections; and advances in biotechnology that may make organisms
    both more lethal and more accessible for use as weapons. There is recognition
    that increasing levels of global disorder and conflict across the world are resulting
    in destruction of public health infrastructure and capacity, reduced access to
    critical services for vulnerable populations, and heightened risk of sudden outbreaks.
    These health risks undermine the economic and political security of nations.  A
    shared recognition has now emerged within U.S. policy circles that indeed the
    world has changed. There is a growing consensus that the rapidity and ferocity
    of successive outbreaks – SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika, H7N9 – means these threats
    cannot be treated as single, episodic events but rather need to be understood
    as a continuous threat that requires ongoing capabilities to prevent, detect,
    and respond, both on the part of the United States and within the international
    community. Reemerging as well as novel pathogens should be expected, both naturally
    occurring and potentially manmade, aided by advances in synthetic biology and
    genetic engineering, as well as changes in climate and land use. With this new
    consensus comes an awareness that national and international approaches have to
    be carefully integrated and investments managed to achieve strategic effect. That
    includes taking steps to ensure that civilian and military agencies are aligned,
    that public health and security spheres understand and support one another, and
    that we plan for and respond to both emergency demands and the need for long-term
    engagement and investment to address continuing trends and challenges.   While
    formidable obstacles remain – in high-level leadership, resources, basic capacities,
    interagency coordination, governance of WHO – we are convinced there is a ripeness
    to health security, an opportunity to press for strengthening America’s policy
    approaches in a way that can drive forward overall U.S. global health engagement,
    bring about new resources, and heighten the engagement of industry and security
    institutions, in partnership with other partner countries, multilateral institutions,
    and civil organizations.'
