There were **4 new cases** reported on November 13th.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified the Merck Ebola vaccine (Ervebo), a critical step that will help speed up its licensing, access and roll-out in countries most at risk of Ebola outbreaks.

Gavi welcomes the European Commission‚Äôs conditional marketing approval for Ervebo.

## WHO prequalifies Ebola vaccine, paving the way for its use in high-risk countries

This is the fastest vaccine prequalification process ever conducted by WHO. Prequalification means that the vaccine meets WHO standards for quality, safety and efficacy. United Nations agencies and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, can procure the vaccine for at-risk countries based on this WHO recommendation. This announcement comes less than 48 hours after the European Commission decision to grant a conditional marketing authorization for the vaccine. Due to the urgent public health need, WHO accelerated prequalification by reviewing safety and efficacy data as the information became available. Representatives from the prequalification team participated in the EMA evaluation process to address programmatic suitability for at-risk countries in Africa.

## Gavi welcomes European Commission approval of first Ebola vaccine

_11/12/19_

Ervebo (rVSVŒîG-ZEBOV-GP) is the first vaccine with clinical efficacy to protect individuals 18 years of age or older at risk of infection with the Ebola virus. At its next meeting in December 2019, the Gavi Board is set to decide on a long-term Gavi Ebola vaccine programme that would include the creation of a global Ebola vaccine stockpile. This stockpile, contingent on the availability of World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified vaccines and SAGE recommendations for their use, will enable countries to access and rapidly deploy Ebola vaccines in response to outbreaks.

In the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the vaccine is being used under ‚Äòcompassionate use‚Äô to protect people. The current stockpile of Ebola investigational vaccine is available in part thanks to an agreement between Gavi and Merck- in January 2016, an Advance Purchase Commitment between Merck and Gavi was signed, creating the stockpile of investigational doses that is being used in DRC and neighbouring countries today. In addition, Gavi has provided US$ 15.1 million to WHO to cover operational costs for the vaccination effort. This also includes US$ 2 million provided to fund vaccinations in neighbouring countries Uganda, South Sudan, Burundi and Rwanda. An additional US$ 13.4 million funding for the vaccination effort in DRC is currently being considered.

2\. There was a press event in Goma today to talk about the start of the use of J&J's #Ebola vaccine on Thursday. Anyone can be vaxxed except children under the age of 1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding can be vaxxed (yay!) & will be followed.
