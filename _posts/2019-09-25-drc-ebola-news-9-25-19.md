There were **4 new cases** as of September 24th.

No health workers are among the new cases. The total number of cases among health workers is 160 (5% of all cases), including 41 deaths.

To assist the DRC’s nine neighbors with advancing critical preparedness measures, the United Nations has developed a regional overview of needs and requirements.

DRC health minister, Eteni Longondo, plans the end of the epidemic in two to three months, given the progress made on the ground.

DRC shares its borders with nine countries and there is regular cross-border movement of people, goods and services in the region. Combined with weaknesses in national health systems, the nine neighboring countries are at very high risk for an Ebola outbreak. The Regional Overview serves as a complement to the Integrated Strategy to Respond to Ebola Virus: Ituri and North Kivu Provinces for the DRC, covering the same period. This document is a consolidated summary of urgent activities required to advance preparedness, with a focus on Priority 1 countries (Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda). It presents the estimated requirements, needs and gaps for each Priority 1 country and a summary for Priority 2 countries (Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Tanzania, and Zambia) as aligned for the period of July to December 2019.

"The assessment is positive. The incidence is zero in some places. In general, the epidemic is declining, the mortality rate too. In two or three months, the epidemic will disappear," said Eteni Longondo in New York, where he is with President Félix Tshisekedi for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Before New York, Longondo had visited areas affected, accompanied by the head of the technical secretariat of the response, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe. Longondo has ushered the introduction of a second vaccine, which was challenged by the outgoing health minister, Oly Ilunga.

Kabasha in #NorthKivu, #DRC is an #Ebola hotspot. It’s in a highly insecure area, so @WHO vaccination teams are using a pop-up vaccination strategy – people in Ebola-risk travel to secure sites, giving both vaccinators and communities more protection. 📸Hugh Kinsella Cunningham

6\. @UNICEF is responsible for working with the affected communities to get their cooperation & work through their concerns. Based on that work, UNICEF says these are the priorities of people in #Ebola affected communities. Heartbreaking — this is not too much to ask for.
