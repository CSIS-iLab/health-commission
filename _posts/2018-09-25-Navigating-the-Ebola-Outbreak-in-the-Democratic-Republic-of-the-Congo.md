_This podcast with WHO Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response Peter Salama, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series_ Take as Directed_, examines the response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that began in July 2018.  Occurring in a conflict-ridden region of DRC, this outbreak illustrates the difficulties of ensuring health security and effective outbreak response in the midst of conflict and disorder._

  
The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that began in July 2018 poses unprecedented challenges to emergency responders as the first ever case in an active warzone. The response has had remarkable mobilization and promising achievements thus far, with successful vaccination campaigns, and a constant readjustment of strategies and resource allocation to best contain the virus. However, six weeks into the response, the outbreak sits on the edge of some of the most insecure and inaccessible areas of the country, where the virus could potentially wreak terrifying levels of devastation. In this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_, Peter Salama, Deputy Director-General of Emergency Preparedness and Response at the World Health Organization, joins CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security Secretariat Director J. Stephen Morrison to provide an inside look at how the response team is navigating the complex dynamics of a highly dangerous outbreak.
