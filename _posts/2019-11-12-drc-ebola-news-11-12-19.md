There was **no new case** reported on November 11th.

Only 1 case was reported over the weekend. 1 community death was also recorded in North Kivu.

The European Commission has granted full licensure to Merck’s Ebola vaccine (Ervebo), which is currently being used in the DRC.

Yesterday, a group of people armed with knives attacked the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Biakato, Ituri.

A local radio station that has been involved in the fight against Ebola in DRC said on Monday it was closing, after one of its broadcasters was murdered last week.

## Ebola vaccine approved in Europe in landmark moment in fight against a deadly disease

The [granting of marketing authorization](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_6246) to Merck’s Ervebo comes less than a month after the European Medicines Agency recommended it be licensed. While the FDA has until March 2020 to issue a decision, a representative said recently that it expects to issue a ruling “well ahead of” the March action date. The vaccine, which protects against the Zaire species of Ebola, was designed at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory with funding from the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). While the vaccine has come to be known as Merck’s Ebola vaccine, scores of researchers and Ebola outbreak response workers in Canada, the U.S., Europe, and Africa played a role in paving Ervebo’s path to licensure. Dr. Tedros lauded the work of the teams of vaccinators who have been using Ervebo in the outbreak in the DRC. Because the vaccine hasn’t been licensed yet in DRC, it will continue to be used there under the compassionate use protocol. Merck expects that licensed doses will become available during the third quarter of 2020.

According to the Human Rights Organization, CODEPEF, the armed individuals wanted to burn a vehicle from the Ebola response team. Police intervened to prevent them from committing this crime, firing several shots into the air. Mambasa's deputy administrator, Obedi Yakani, says security is being tightened at Biakato General Hospital to prevent any attack on the ETC. An investigation was opened by the police to find the perpetrators.

Joel Musavuli, head of Lwemba radio in Mambasa, Ituri, told AFP that the station had been targeted by armed groups hostile to the campaign to roll back the Ebola epidemic. "Each of us have received threats since last month. We have now decided to stop broadcasting, Musavuli said, adding that he himself had escaped two kidnap attempts. On November 2, Lwemba broadcaster Papy Mahamba was killed at his home by unidentified men-his wife was injured, and their house set ablaze. Several radio stations in the Mambasa area say they have stopped broadcasting anti-Ebola messages because of intimidation.

‏ Many people worked for years — almost a quarter century, if you start the clock with the development of the VSV vaccine platform — to bring an #Ebola vaccine through licensure. I'm reminded today how a number of them felt when it first went into the field.
