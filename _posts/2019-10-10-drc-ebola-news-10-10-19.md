There was **1 new case** reported on October 9th.

Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, explains that the disease has moved into more rural and more insecure areas.

Speaking to the UN Security Council yesterday, Leila Zerrougui, Head of MONUSCO, notes some positive trends that could transform DRC into a stable country.

## Congo's Ebola outbreak slows but still entrenched in insecure areas: WHO

WHO says the Ebola epidemic has been confined to a rural area rife with militias and people on the move, making it harder to stamp out altogether. “The virus is essentially back where it began,” Ryan said, and that the outbreak was confined to a geographic triangle stretching between the towns of Mambasa, Komanda, Oicha and Mandima, though it was still spreading at a low level. “We are really reaching a point where we are more and more on top of things, more and more on top of surveillance, more and more on top of infection prevention and control,” Ryan said. “The problem is it’s back in areas that are deeply insecure.”

Zerrougui listed some developments since the installation of President Félix Tshisekedi, such as the regional diplomatic initiatives that have been rolled out, a coalition government put in place with an ambitious intention to stabilize the country, improve governance of the country, and boost the national level of economic development. She also mentioned that building community acceptance for Ebola response efforts remains a daily challenge, “which reminds us of the importance to address not only Ebola but also respond to broader needs of the population including on safety, healthcare, sanitation and education.” China added that the Ebola epidemic, armed group violence and intercommunal conflict, have worsened the humanitarian situation in some areas of DRC.

J&J vaccine to be rolled out soon in Goma and may provide a firewall against Ebola. Messaging to locals is that J&J is preventative vaccine, while the Merck vaccine is used in outbreak areas for rapid response and containment — as it takes only one dose & works faster.
