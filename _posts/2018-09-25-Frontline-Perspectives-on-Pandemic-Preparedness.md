The world of global health security was awash in headlines in May 2018—from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to the elimination of the Global Health Security Directorate within the White House National Security Council staff. This episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_ features three leading health security experts with substantial frontline experience who discuss the state of preparedness around the world, gaps and priorities looking ahead, and how to maintain pandemic preparedness as a high-level political priority in times of peace. Beth Cameron, Vice President of Global Biological Policy and Programs at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a member of the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security expert advisory group, serves as the guest host for this discussion, alongside featured guests Amadou Sall, CEO of Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal, and Andrew Kitua, Africa Regional Director of the USAID Preparedness and Response project.
