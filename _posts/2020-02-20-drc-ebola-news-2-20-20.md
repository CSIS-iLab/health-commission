_WHO, 2/20/20_

During the past week, the incidence of new Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases has remained low (Figure 1). From 12 to 18 February, one new confirmed case was reported. The case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case reported on 5 February. To maintain operations and prevent re-emergence of the outbreak, WHO is requesting funding. USD $40 million is currently needed to ensure continuity of response and preparedness activities to bring the case incidence to zero, and continue building strong, resilient health systems.

 "The fight against Ebola has a new start. The (...) Ervebo vaccine, will now be able to be manufactured in quantity to build up stocks and be widely distributed in areas exposed to the risk of an outbreak of the epidemic."
