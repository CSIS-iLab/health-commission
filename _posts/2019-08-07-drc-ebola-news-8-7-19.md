There were **7 new cases** as of August 6th.

More than 500 children have died from the virus.

Locals of north-eastern DRC who still refuse to be vaccinated against the Ebola virus were interviewed to know their reasons.

Rwanda and DRC are discouraging travel across their border to prevent further spread.

A citizen movement in Goma has called for the governors of North Kivu and Ituri Provinces to monitor how funds allocated to the Ebola response are being managed.

The investigation into the [death of Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-04-2019-who-ebola-responder-killed-in-attack-on-the-butembo-hospital), WHO epidemiologist who was killed in an attack in April, is coming to an end.

“This is another grim milestone in a crisis that is devastating children in its path, especially the youngest,” said Heather Kerr, Save the Children’s country director in DRC. Just under 100 children died from contracting Ebola in the six months following when the outbreak began. In the next six months, more than four times as many children have died. About 737 children are thought to have contracted the disease from this outbreak.

## DRC Ebola: The reasons for mistrust of the vaccine

Some Beni residents say they do not trust this vaccine, which they say is still in an experimental phase. Others do not understand why the international community is mobilizing against Ebola, while no one has come to their aid in the face of massacres committed for years by rebels in the region. A woman commented that "the fight against Ebola must go hand in hand with the end of the massacres." Local authorities have been called upon to raise awareness and convince the population to support the fight against this deadly disease; Imams, priests and pastors have received training to raise awareness among the faithful of different religious denominations.

## Rwanda, Congo restrict unnecessary border travel amid Ebola

Travel restrictions are part of measures taken by Rwandan and Congolese health officials who met in Rwanda. People traveling across the border for non-essential reasons, such as attending workshops and religious crusades, will need clearance from both governments, according to a statement issued Tuesday following the meeting in Rwanda’s western Rubavu province. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that the risk of regional spread of Ebola is “very high” but discourages travel restrictions. Any border closure is likely to push travelers to avoid official border posts, where people are checked for signs of Ebola symptoms. Rwanda briefly closed its border with Congo last week after an Ebola case was confirmed in Goma; DRC’s government condemned this decision to close the border before it was reopened hours later.

## DRC Ebola: Citizen movement accuses some agents of wanting to get rich with funds allocated to the response

This call was launched by the citizen movement, Synergy Young Leaders "SJL-DRC", in a statement issued today in Goma. The youth in this movement recommended to the governors of two provinces affected by Ebola to control the management of funds and report to the president, take tough measures to agents that are not doing their jobs appropriately, and control NGOs engaged in the response. **These young people believe that there is a certain "lack of sense of patriotism among some agents working in the response" by making the fight against Ebola an "easy way to get rich".**

## Ebola DRC: Investigation complete into murder of WHO epidemiologist

Today, it was revealed that more than 50 people, including about 20 who have confessed to having participated in the murder of the WHO doctor, and three doctors, have been arrested. They are alleged to be involved in the murder of Dr. Richard Mouzoko and in attacks targeting several Ebola response facilities, including the Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs). Colonel Kumbu Ngoma Marcel, magistrate at the operational military court of North Kivu said, "the prosecution conducts the investigations, concludes the case, transmits the case to the court, and it is up to the court to decide whether to hold the hearings, but in our case, within one or two weeks." This trial, much awaited in Butembo, "can elucidate the motive of these attacks," said Mr. Edgar Mateso, vice president of the civil society of North Kivu.

3\. Another way #Ebola spreads: in hospitals. So-called nosocomial infections are generally the way Ebola outbreaks take off; they bubble at low levels in a community until an infected person goes to a clinic, infects a bunch of health workers & patients & the lightbulb goes off.

What is an epishuttle?🙄 It's not a space capsule, but a high-tech isolation bubble used for medical evacuations. Here, a team from Norway, deployed to #DRCongo via the EU, are conducting a training with the EU and @WHO on how to use the epishuttle in the fight against Ebola.
