At the outbreak’s peak in April, roughly 300 new infections were reported in three weeks. Between 25 September and 15 October, fifty people were diagnosed with Ebola in the DRC. The drop in infections is not a reason to relax efforts to contain the virus, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on 18 October. “We must treat every case as if it is the first since every case has the potential to spark a new outbreak,” he said. Ebola responders have pushed the virus out of Beni, but the virus continues to spread in remote parts of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, where violence has complicated response efforts.

More positive news came on 18 October after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended that the European Commission (EC) approve the Merck Ebola vaccine which is currently being used in DRC. The EC will decide within 10 weeks on whether to approve the vaccine for sale. The US FDA fast-tracked the vaccine’s application for approval in September, and a decision is expected in March 2020. Seven other experimental Ebola vaccines are at earlier development stages.
