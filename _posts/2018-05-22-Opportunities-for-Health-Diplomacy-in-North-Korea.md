_This podcast with Dr. Kee B. Park, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series_ Take as Directed, _illuminates the challenges of the disordered world for health security through the case of North Korea._

Amidst historic talks between the U.S. and North Korea, this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_ offers an inside look at the health challenges North Korea faces and opportunities for progress that can be achieved through diplomacy. For this discussion, we turn to Dr. Kee B. Park, Paul Farmer Global Surgery Scholar at Harvard Medical School and Director of North Korea Programs for the Korean American Medical Association. After returning from a trip to North Korea, Dr. Park joins CSIS Commission on Strengthening Americaâ€™s Health Security Secretariat Director J. Stephen Morrison to discuss his latest visit, the potential impacts of economic sanctions on humanitarian engagement, and the operating environment that influenced the Global Fund's 2018 decision to close its TB and malaria programs in North Korea. We conclude by hearing about exciting new initiatives Dr. Park is pursuing to strengthen U.S.-North Korea collaboration in the health sector and his optimism looking forward.
