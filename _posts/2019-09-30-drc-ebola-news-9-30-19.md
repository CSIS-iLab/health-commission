There were **3 new cases** as of September 29th.

US and UK government officials are warning travelers of the possibility of a concealed Ebola outbreak in Tanzania, after WHO reported that the government there is withholding information about possible cases of the deadly virus.

Strains of the Ebola virus have been imported to Japan for the development of diagnostic kits ahead of the expected influx of visitors for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo.

## Possible cover-up of Ebola outbreak in Tanzania prompts travel warnings

[_Ars Technica_<i/>{:class=”icon-external-link”}](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/possible-cover-up-of-ebola-outbreak-in-tanzania-prompts-travel-warnings/){:target=”_blank”}{:rel=”noopener”}

_By Beth Mole, 9/30/19_

The [US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tanzania) and the [State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/tanzania-travel-advisory.html) updated their travel advisories for Tanzania late Friday, September 27. The CDC’s warning briefly summarizes the situation outlined by the WHO, noting that the doctor who died had a “probable” case of Ebola, and warned that “travelers should remain aware of the situation and avoid direct contact with people who are ill, when possible and should monitor themselves for symptoms of Ebola both during and for 3 weeks after travel.” The State Department likewise suggests that people visiting Tanzania “exercise increased caution.” Its warning was more concise, but it still called the doctor’s death a “probable” case of Ebola.

The UK’s warning notes that the WHO declared the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in July and that cases have spilled over to Uganda.

## U.S. and U.K. alert travelers to Tanzania about possible unreported Ebola cases

Rumors have swirled since mid-September about positive Ebola tests and relatives and contacts forced into involuntary quarantine. Concern about the situation has been amplified by the fact that Tanzanian health authorities are typically cooperative with international partners.

Under the International Health Regulations, a global treaty to which Tanzania is a signatory, countries are obliged to notify the WHO immediately when they have outbreaks of serious infectious diseases that could pose a risk to their neighbors and the wider world. In exchange for meeting the obligation to report, the treaty protects countries with disease outbreaks by instructing other nations not to take actions to restrict trade or travel. The WHO has been publicly silent about the matter since it issued the statement on Sept. 21. There is no information to suggest the dead woman had traveled to DRC, but that doesn’t preclude the possibility that she might have been infected. She might have had contact in Uganda with an unreported case there — the country borders DRC and has had several cases where infected people have crossed into the country.

## Japan imports Ebola virus for research

The government of Japan obtained Ebola, Lassa, South American, Crimean-Congo and Marburg viruses from two foreign research facilities to a branch facility of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Musashimurayama, a Tokyo suburb. The decision to import these viruses was finalized in July after discussions with residents near the facility.

2\. I do not know if it's to be trusted. I also don't know if the #Ebola response has a good handle on what's happening at Lwemba, where violence forced suspension of work for days recently. BUT... numbers are dropping in a big way. September will have fewer cases than March.
