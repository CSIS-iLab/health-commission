There were **2 new cases** as of September 8th.

Hotspots such as Beni Health Zone show signs of easing. The limited access and insecurity in the emerging clusters within Kalunguta, Mandima, and Mambasa health zones have hindered response activities.

To prevent the spread of in health facilities, the DRC Ministry of Health launched a guideline and training package that targets at least 3,000 health care workers.

_9/6/19_

With the current attention on how health facilities with Ebola-specific response units continue the spread of the virus, the DRC government is intent on covering all weak points. Infection prevention staff training is ongoing, using standard guidelines recently revised by a team of technical specialists from the Health Ministry, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 18% of the total cases registered in late August were hospital-acquired infections. At least 155 health care workers have been infected with the Ebola virus disease since the beginning of this tenth outbreak. WHO is supporting the DRC health ministry in boosting infection prevention and hygiene training with funding from USAID, UK DFID, and the World Bank. The training package integrates measures related to water management, sanitation and hygiene. The guidelines and training package will be rolled out over the next three months.

No #Ebola cases have been recorded in #Tanzania but many communities in Kigoma Region face the threat of importation due to cross-border movements for trade. @WHO & partners supported the 🇹🇿MOH to carry out simulation drills across at-risk regions. ➡️[https://bit.ly/2m1Ufqj](https://bit.ly/2m1Ufqj "https://bit.ly/2m1Ufqj")
