_The New Humanitarian, 1/29/20_

Residents of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern region of Beni have been at the center of the world’s second deadliest Ebola epidemic for more than 17 months. But now they are contending with the resurgence of another, longer-running crisis: attacks by armed groups that have killed more than 260 people — mostly women and children — in the past 12 weeks alone.

_CIDRAP, 1/29/20_

The WHO yesterday released a detailed weekly situation report on the outbreak, which said that, for the week ending Jan 26, four cases were reported in Beni, three of them in registered contacts. The report noted that the fourth was not on the contact list and had stayed in the community for 4 days before admission to an Ebola treatment center.

[#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click): 1 case yesterday, at Beni, which is likely to have more cases soon because 1 of yesterday's 2 deaths was a community death. Ugh. Totals: 3421 cases, 2242 deaths. The response is really using a lot of the VSV vaccine lately. Over 1000 doses most recent days.
