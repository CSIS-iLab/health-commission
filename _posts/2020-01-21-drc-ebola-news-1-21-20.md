Without doubt, Ervebo could be a game changer in tackling future Ebola outbreaks. But, in order to help protect health workers and communities, the vaccine must be delivered safely, sustainably, and equitably. That seems unlikely in many countries where Ebola is endemic, owing to security, systemic and social challenges. Unless these challenges are addressed, Ervebo won’t be effective.

Another health worker in DRC has been infected with [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hash), the 2nd such report in 2 days. Like yesterday, this person was vaccinated. No information on how long ago that happened. According to [@WHO](https://twitter.com/WHO), this would be the 172nd HCW infection. 2 cases reported Sunday, no deaths.

“The Ervebo vaccine should not be viewed as a magic bullet for preventing and addressing future Ebola outbreaks”. Stronger health systems, safety and security, community engagement and empowerment are essential too.
