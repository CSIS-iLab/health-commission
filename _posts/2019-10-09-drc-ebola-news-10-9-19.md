There was **1 new case** reported on October 8th.

Although the decline in the number of new cases is encouraging, WHO notes that the recent fluctuations in case numbers must be interpreted with caution, as case reporting is contingent upon the level of access and security.

The patient in Sweden with a possible case of Ebola has tested negative.

Starting next month, the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Ebola vaccine will be used in DRC.

## Situation Report - Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in DRC

During mid-September, serious security incidents in Lwemba Health Area, Mandima, stalled outbreak response activities for more than two weeks. Response activities have since resumed but remain limited. Last week, an open forum for discussion and reconciliation was held in Lwemba with partners and civil society to dispel mistrust and enhance engagement in future response activities. **Improved access may result in enhanced case finding and an increase in the number of reported cases from the area.**

Of the approximately 1555 confirmed cases admitted to Ebola treatment centers, 1000 of them, or nearly two thirds, have survived. The reintegration of survivors into community can create opportunities to discuss their experiences and strengthen the participation of local communities in the response. Many survivors are working within the response.

Under Pillar 1 of the Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. **As of 8 October 2019, US$ 60.4 million has been** [**received**](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding) **by WHO**, with additional funds committed or pledged. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 and into Q1 2020.

Under Pillar 5 Regional Preparedness, the funding requirement for all partners is US$ 66 milllion, of which WHO requires US$ 21 million**. As of 8 October 2019, WHO has received US$ 1.6 million**. While some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighbouring countries is urgently needed.

At a press conference yesterday, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe announced that the J&J vaccine will be used from next November. In May, the WHO expert group on immunization made two recommendations for the use of a second preventive vaccine in DRC. "Our choice fell on the Johnson-Johnson vaccine because it had more biological data in the lab and is already used in West Africa, and it is used in Uganda and Rwanda,‚Äù said Dr. Muyembe.
