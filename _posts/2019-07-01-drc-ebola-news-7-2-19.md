Over the weekend and through July 1, the DRC ministry of health recorded 41 more cases of the deadly disease, including another case detected in a vaccinated health worker. Late last week, the UN voiced concerns about ongoing massacres and ethnic violence in the DRC's Ituri province, and said the disease was moving into small, forest-based villages such as Alima, where access is "more challenging." Over the weekend the DRC health ministry described a cluster of five cases from Beni, including a mother who fled Ituri province with her children. The family was transferred back to Ituri province for care. Late last week, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the minister of health in the DRC, held a meeting in Kinshasa to review experimental Ebola vaccine candidates from Merck, Johnson & Johnson, CanSino Biologics Inc, and Rospotrebnadzor. However, DRC officials did not opt to approve any other vaccine for use in the outbreak at this point.

## WHO applauds Uganda's Ebola response

“We appreciate the investment that has gone into making sure the system is up and ready, to deal with patients when they arise. And we can only commit to continuing to support until the risk from across border in DRC is over. Because we have keep up these arrangements, this team, ready in case somebody else needs treatment,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s Regional Director for Africa. More than 100 people who had contacts with the confirmed cases are being monitored. Since the outbreak was declared, 1063 high-risk individuals have been vaccinated. A little over two weeks ago, Uganda cleared three experimental Ebola treatments, as it watches for its spread.

Very happy to see my friend @AntipasMbusaN visiting communities in Butembo, #DRC, affected by #Ebola. Bipartisan political leadership, with community engagement and ownership, are vital to ending the outbreak.
