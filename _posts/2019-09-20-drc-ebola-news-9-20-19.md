The security event was a community response to the death of a local healthcare worker from Ebola. Due to the violence that occurred during the incident, all activities have been suspended in the Lwemba area until further notice. This could lead to gaps or delays in the reporting of new Ebola cases in this hotspot area. Security incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities throughout areas with active transmission and high-risk areas.

Under the WHO [Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/drc-srp4-9august2019.pdf?sfvrsn=679e4d26_2&ua=1&ua=1), the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is US$ 287 million, including US$ 120-140 million for WHO. As of 19 September 2019, close to US$ 60 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. **Currently available funds will close the financing gap just up until the end of October 2019**. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019.

David Gressly, United Nations Coordinator for Ebola in the DRC, says he will travel to New York City in the coming days to present the Ebola situation and seek the necessary resources to support the efforts of the partners involved in this fight. During his tour in Ituri, he expressed his delight with the discussions he had with partners on ground and community leaders. This week, Gressly also met with Secretary Azar and other officials from the current US Administration in Butembo, North Kivu.

Ebola, cholera, measles - the most severe disease outbreaks usually occur in the places with the weakest health systems. As leaders we must "fix the roof before the rain comes" and take responsibility for emergency preparedness [http://bit.ly/GPMBreport2019](http://bit.ly/GPMBreport2019 "http://bit.ly/GPMBreport2019") #AWorldatRisk
