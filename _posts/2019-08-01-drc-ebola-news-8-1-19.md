One year ago today, WHO confirmed the first 4 Ebola cases in the DRC’s current outbreak. Back then, hopes were high that a vaccine could squash the outbreak quickly. The challenges of containing Ebola have been immense, and experts worry that it is still far from over.

There were **13 new cases** as of July 31st.

The 1-year-old daughter of the man who died of Ebola in Goma yesterday has the disease, DRC’s health ministry confirms.

Rumors flood that Rwanda shut its border with DRC yesterday, but health ministry clarifies that borders remain open.

The virus is spreading in a deeply impoverished part of the country that's been ravaged by various militias since the final days of the Mobutu Sese Seko dictatorship in the mid-1990s. Amid all the challenges, the World Health Organization (WHO) is begging for more money from international donors. On Tuesday, Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said WHO has budgeted $350 million for its response for the rest of 2019. "I don't mean to be overly alarmist, but I'm very concerned about the situation," says Dr. Daniel Bausch, who's worked on Ebola research for more than two decades. "I think there's still a risk of this being like the West Africa outbreak," Bausch says. "Given the limited amount of vaccine that's available and the really concerning epidemiologic curves \[rise in cases\] we've seen over the last few weeks, I think we should be prepared for a long outbreak that will still go on for many months or years."

This is the first transmission of Ebola inside Goma, a city of more than 1 million people on the Rwandan border. The painstaking work of finding, tracking and vaccinating people who had contact with the man — and the contacts of those contacts — has begun. The death of the man yesterday “in such a dense population center underscores the very real risk of further disease transmission, perhaps beyond the country’s borders, and the very urgent need” for more global support, United Nations agencies said in a [joint statement](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/31-07-2019-at-1-year-mark-we-mourn-the-lives-lost-and-call-for-solidarity) marking a year of the outbreak.

## Rwanda Shuts Border With Congo Over Ebola Outbreak

Despite the WHO and other aid groups’ advice against closing borders, the Rwandan government took the decision, which was quickly condemned by the DRC government, after a third case of the virus was discovered in Goma. “The closure is a measure to stop the spread” of Ebola, said Olivier Nduhungirehe, Rwanda’s deputy foreign minister. “At the moment we can’t tell how long this will last but we are not taking any chances.” Thousands of people were stranded today on both sides of the crossing between Goma and the Rwandan town of Gisenyi, the busiest point along the roughly 100-mile border between the two countries. Goma is the region’s main trading hub for minerals and the regional headquarters of many international aid organizations.

_More news on Rwandan border closure_: In several tweets by the Rwandan [foreign affairs minister](https://twitter.com/onduhungirehe/status/1156861703323299840) and [health ministry](https://twitter.com/RwandaGov/status/1156939342897700864), there has been clarification that the DRC border remains “open for travels as usual”, and caution for citizens to “avoid unnecessary travels to affected areas”.

\[_Thread_\] The Eastern DRC Ebola outbreak is now a year old. Why has it lasted this long, and does this mean that the health security reforms since 2015 haven't delivered? A few quick thoughts:
