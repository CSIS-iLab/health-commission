_This podcast with European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and European Union Ebola Coordinator Christos Stylianides, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series_ Take as Directed_, examines the European Union’s role in the May-June 2018 Ebola response effort, with comparisons to the 2014 Ebola response on which much of global health security today is built.  Following the recording of this podcast, the CSIS Commission hosted a private lunch discussion with Dr. Stylianides._

Dr. Christos Stylianides serves as the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and is the European Union Ebola Coordinator. In this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_, Christos joins CSIS Commission Secretariat Co-Director J. Stephen Morrison to discuss how the current Ebola response has differed from the response in 2014 and the leading role that Europe is playing in that response. He also discusses his current work to expand resources for education services for children and adolescents living through crises and emergency situations. 

Hosted by J. Stephen Morrison. Produced by Alex Bush. Edited by Ribka Gemilangsari.
