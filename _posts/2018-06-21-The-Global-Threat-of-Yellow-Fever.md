_This podcast with Georgetown University O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law Senior Scholar Daniel Lucey, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series "Take as Directed", delves into the threat of yellow fever. In illuminating preparedness and response efforts for one particular infectious disease, Lucey offers broader lessons for high-risk disease outbreak preparedness and response, a core focus of the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security._

In 2016, the World Health Organization announced that a single full dose of yellow fever vaccine would provide lifelong protection from the virus. However, due to global shortages and complicated production requirements, there has not been sufficient supply to meet the demands of recent outbreaks. Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 and Brazil in 2018 have turned to using fractional doses, or about 1/5 of a full dose, as a stopgap measure—these diluted doses only offer one year of protection against the virus. In this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed,_ Daniel Lucey, a senior scholar with the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University,  joins CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security Secretariat Director J. Stephen Morrison to discuss the threat of yellow fever, our lack of preparedness, and the potential for a significant outbreak in Asia.
