_11/14/19_

All six cases resulted from local transmission in Beni and in Mabalako Health Zones in North Kivu, and all were known contacts of a confirmed case. While all cases can be linked to earlier transmission chains in Biakato Mines Health Area, Mandima Health Zone (Ituri), that health area has not reported a case since 4 November. **As the number of cases decreases steadily, other case indicators appear to be encouraging**. The proportion of registered contacts among cases prior to symptom onset is increasing over time, reaching 100% (6/6) in the past 7 days. Trends in proportion of community deaths among confirmed cases have also improved. A shorter delay from symptom onset to admission to isolation of alive EVD patients has also been reported. However, concerns remain around the recent shift of cases to Mabalako Health Zone. Ongoing local transmission in Bingo and Ngoyo Health Areas in Mabalako Health Zone is challenging because security issues have caused access and response difficulties in these areas.

## MSF begins administering new Ebola vaccine in DRC

_11/13/19_

Approximately 23,000 doses of the J&J (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) vaccine have arrived in the country. The study will result in more data on this second Ebola vaccine, which could pave the way for another approved tool to fight future Ebola epidemics. MSF community engagement teams have been meeting with people in Majengo and Kahembe health districts in Goma to share information about the vaccine and answer their questions. These two districts were identified in collaboration with health authorities as the first to be offered the vaccine. The vaccine will be offered to adults and to children aged one and older, and target 50,000 people over a four-month period.
