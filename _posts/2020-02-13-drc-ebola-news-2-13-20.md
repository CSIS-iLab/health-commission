_UN News, 2/12/20_

The World Health Organization ([WHO](https://www.who.int/)) convened its Emergency Committee which reaffirmed that the risk remains high at the national and regional levels, but low globally. “It was the unanimous view of the Committee that this event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)”, the UN agency said in a [statement](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-02-2020-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-for-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-on-12-february-2020). “The Committee was concerned that withdrawing the PHEIC now might have adverse consequences for the response efforts through diminishing focus.”

_WHO, 2/13/20_

On 12 February 2020, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from Very High down to High at the national and regional levels, while the risk level was maintained as Low at the global level. WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. This assessment acknowledged improvements in case incidence and other epidemiological indicators, and the strengthened local and regional capacities. Dynamics of the outbreak, however, remain contingent upon access for response teams to affected areas. Continued insecurity remains a barrier the outbreak response effort.

2\. This week's [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) update from [@WHO](https://twitter.com/WHO) has posted. There were only 3 cases in the past week, all from the same (last?) transmission chain. The most recent case was isolated within a day of getting sick, which really reduces the risk he or she will infect anyone else.

3\. The trend in this [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) outbreak looks so promising. But as [@WHO](https://twitter.com/WHO) warns, progress is always fragile. So often the footprint of the outbreak has shrunk, only to expand again. Hoping this truly is the last quarter mile of the road.
