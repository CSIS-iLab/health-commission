It turns out that a 9-yr old girl recently diagnosed w/#Ebola in #Uganda had gone to a health facility in #DRC mid-August & the health worker roomed her w/a person who had Ebola. They've both since died. Clinic-derived infections have a chilling effect.

I've just returned from #DRC, reviewing the #Ebola response with UNSG @antonioguterres. I was reminded once again: when people don’t have access to health services, or those services are of poor quality or don’t meet their needs, diseases can spread & lives can be lost.
