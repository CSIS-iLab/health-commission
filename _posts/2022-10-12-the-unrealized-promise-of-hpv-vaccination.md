The human papillomavirus ([HPV](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/vaccination.htm)) is an underappreciated threat to women’s health. A sexually transmitted virus that infects girls when they are young, HPV can lie dormant for years and threatens to develop into cervical cancer decades later, killing women in the prime of their lives. Accelerating the introduction of several [highly effective ](https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.223.13/kj6.db4.mwp.accessdomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPV-Slide-Deck.pdf?time=1629097857)HPV vaccines during early adolescence therefore [presents](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-3798) a transformational [opportunity ](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(21)02178-4.pdf)to save [lives](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l1161) and [livelihoods](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1917338). But strengthening HPV vaccination is not only a long-term [strategic investment ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/her-health-her-lifetime-our-world)that could help win the [global fight ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-experience-addressing-cervical-cancer)against cervical cancer—getting delivery right for HPV vaccines presents an unrealized near-term opportunity to strengthen immunization across the life course and contribute to the defense against future pandemic threats.

HPV vaccination platforms can serve as an entry point for adolescents to access many other [health](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.021) services, including routine and emergency interventions such as Covid-19 vaccination. Yet as high costs and volatile supply have created implementation challenges, countries have tended to undervalue HPV vaccination programs, devoting resources to other seemingly more immediate health threats. As a result, HPV vaccination coverage has [lagged ](https://www.path.org/resources/global-hpv-vaccine-introduction-overview/)far behind that of other vaccines. This gap has expanded further as the Covid-19 pandemic has [stretched ](https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5406/file/Human-Papillomavirus-Vaccine-Market-%20Update-October202#:\~:text=Global%20HPV%20vaccine%20supply%20availability,45.5%20million%20doses%20in%202021.)health systems to their limits and HPV vaccine programs have been [paused](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.013)—global [coverage ](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/)has plummeted [15 percent ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/wuenic-progress-and-challenges-15-july-2022.pdf?sfvrsn=b5eb9141_7&download=true)since 2019. Beyond the operational challenges, the need for early intervention to prevent viral infection before girls reach sexual maturity means that HPV vaccination can sometimes stir controversy and provoke sensitivities around sexual norms, puberty, or fertility in some communities.

Meanwhile, cervical cancer continues to kill one person every [two minutes](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/who-says-just-one-dose-hpv-vaccine-protects-against-cervical-cancer), with the majority of those deaths disproportionately concentrated among women in Sub-Saharan Africa.

To regain lost ground and fully realize this opportunity to safeguard women’s health and strengthen a foundation for pandemic preparedness, the United States and global partners should consider the following strategies to bolster HPV immunization:

**1. Plan long-term to stabilize supply.** The global supply of HPV vaccines is [improving](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/mi4a/who-mi4a-global-market-study-hpv.pdf?sfvrsn=649561b3_1&download=true), but has been unpredictable and is likely to remain tenuous as manufacturers scale up production. As international organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance continue to negotiate prices down, bilateral and multilateral partners could provide targeted assistance to help both low- and middle-income countries forecast their vaccine needs over the next several years to ensure demand meets increasing supply and eventually [stabilizes ](https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5406/file/Human-Papillomavirus-Vaccine-Market-%20Update-October202#:\~:text=Global%20HPV%20vaccine%20supply%20availability,45.5%20million%20doses%20in%202021.)the marketplace.

**2. Integrate services to build resilience.** There is an opportunity to [link ](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/options-for-linking-health-interventions-for-adolescents-with-hpv-vaccination)existing local health programs provided to young adolescents with HPV vaccine delivery. This could make HPV vaccination more cost-effective for countries, less burdensome for health workers, more accessible for families, and less vulnerable to disruption in the face of future health crises.

**3. Focus on demand generation.** Introducing an unfamiliar vaccine to an underreached, potentially hesitant adolescent population at the sensitive age of puberty requires targeted efforts to build trust, acceptance, and uptake in communities. This is expensive and time-intensive. Committing additional financial resources to countries that are introducing HPV vaccination, over a longer timeline—including through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—could help provide low-income countries the resources they need to generate and sustain demand for HPV vaccines.

The push for expanded HPV vaccination is motivated by an imperative to eliminate one of the world’s deadliest cancers. But the failure to prioritize and scale such a powerful tool would also be a wider missed opportunity: a chance to build bridges for girls and young women to access critical health services, including and beyond HPV vaccination, during future health security emergencies.

### **Persistent Challenges**

The 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) [prequalification](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines) of the first HPV vaccines was a major moment for women’s health. Approximately [4.5 percent](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.30716) of all global cancer cases are attributable to HPV, and the vast majority—604,000 cases and 342,000 deaths [in 2020 ](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer)—are from cervical cancer, the [fourth](https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21660)-most common and deadly cancer in women. The [original HPV vaccines ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/position_paper_documents/human-papillomavirus-(hpv)/pp-hpv-may2017-summary.pdf?sfvrsn=cc5bf93e_2)from Merck and GSK were [shown ](https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.223.13/kj6.db4.mwp.accessdomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPV-Slide-Deck.pdf?time=1629097857)to be over 90 percent effective in preventing most HPV-related cancers, and could [reduce](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30157-4) cervical cancer mortality by up to 99 percent if paired with screening and treatment later in life. But even with an armory of such [powerful](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.12184) and [cost](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260808)-effective [vaccines](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(14)70237-2.pdf), integrating them into national immunization schedules has proven difficult due to a combination of cost, supply, delivery, and demand challenges, and under-prioritization by political leadership in the face of other immediate health threats.

**High Costs Drive Disparity**

At the time they were introduced, HPV vaccines were more expensive than other vaccines and limited in supply, meaning that high-income countries [were able to purchase doses and introduce ](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311275/WHO-IVB-19.04-eng.pdf)the vaccines much earlier and more quickly than low- and middle-income countries. The [147 countries and territories ](https://media.path.org/documents/Global_Vaccine_Intro_Overview_Slides_Final_PATHwebsite_MAR_2022_qT92Wwh.pdf?_gl=1*1fafk2u*_ga*MTA4Njc3OTEyOS4xNjU2MzU0NDAw*_ga_YBSE7ZKDQM*MTY1ODkwNjg4OC4yLjEuMTY1ODkwNjg5My4w)that have introduced HPV vaccination since 2006 are still disproportionately high-income, and cover just a [third ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/wuenic-progress-and-challenges-15-july-2022.pdf?sfvrsn=b5eb9141_7&download=true)of eligible girls—aged 9 to 14 years-old—globally. Meanwhile, low- and middle-income countries bear over [80 percent](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30860-4) of cervical cancer cases and [90 percent ](https://secureservercdn.net/192.169.223.13/kj6.db4.mwp.accessdomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPV-Slide-Deck.pdf?time=1629097857)of deaths, with the greatest [concentration](https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21660) of incidence and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, where it is the [leading ](https://www.bushcenter.org/explore-our-work/taking-action/partnership-to-end-aids-and-cervical-cancer.html)cause of cancer death in women.

[![](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Forthcoming%20global%20health%20commentary%20on%20HPV_Graphics_Updated%20%281%29.jpg?qD9cG3fV0obTm2kRSVTK3wpv6J8dkAAt)](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Forthcoming%20global%20health%20commentary%20on%20HPV_Graphics_Updated%20%281%29.jpg?qD9cG3fV0obTm2kRSVTK3wpv6J8dkAAt)

To address this disparity, in 2012 [Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ](https://www.gavi.org/types-support/vaccine-support/human-papillomavirus)negotiated the HPV vaccine cost down from $100 per dose for the highest income countries to just $4.50 per dose for the low-income countries it supports. Gavi also began to support country introduction efforts, cofinancing the vaccines themselves along with initial delivery costs. Both Merck and GSK have [committed ](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/document/supply-procurement/vaccine-price-commitments-from-manufacturers.pdf)to provide HPV vaccines to countries at the same Gavi-negotiated price for a limited time after they “graduate” from Gavi support to become fully self-financing.

Still, more work is needed to close the equity [gap](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100836).

Middle-income countries, which have historically been [ineligible ](https://www.gavi.org/types-support/sustainability/eligibility)for Gavi support, face particular challenges. Some progress has been made, with Gavi’s [new ](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/board/minutes/2022/22-june/Board-2022-Mtg-02-Review-of-Decisions.pdf)middle-income-countries [strategy ](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/board/minutes/2020/15-dec/07%20-%20Gavi%27s%20approach%20to%20engagement%20with%20former%20and%20never-eligible%20MICs.pdf)allowing for targeted support to countries above the traditional income eligibility levels, and manufacturers offering lower, scaled pricing for middle-income clients. Even so, countries in the Americas that procure HPV vaccines through the [PAHO Revolving Fund](https://www.paho.org/en/revolvingfund), which negotiates collectively on behalf of the region’s mostly middle-income countries, still pay twice the cost per dose of Gavi-eligible countries. Middle-income countries in other regions that self-finance their vaccines through [UNICEF ](https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5411/file/Human-Papillomavirus-Vaccine-Market-Update-December2019.pdf)pay at least [triple](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7898307/#ijgo13482-bib-0012). These high prices limit countries’ [appetite ](https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5406/file/Human-Papillomavirus-Vaccine-Market-%20Update-October202#:\~:text=Global%20HPV%20vaccine%20supply%20availability,45.5%20million%20doses%20in%202021.)to pursue introduction. Even some Gavi-eligible countries such as [Ghana](https://www.gavi.org/programmes-impact/country-hub/africa/ghana), which has implemented [successful](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.027) HPV [pilot projects](https://doi.org/10.4314%2Fgmj.v52i2.6), have [not yet scaled ](https://media.path.org/documents/Global_Vaccine_Intro_Overview_Slides_Final_PATHwebsite_MAR_2022_qT92Wwh.pdf?_gl=1*1fafk2u*_ga*MTA4Njc3OTEyOS4xNjU2MzU0NDAw*_ga_YBSE7ZKDQM*MTY1ODkwNjg4OC4yLjEuMTY1ODkwNjg5My4w)immunization nationally out of [uncertainty over ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/healthy-experiments)how they would sustain programs once they eventually became ineligible for Gavi pricing.

In 2016, as the speed of introductions continued to lag, Gavi and the [WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization ](https://www.who.int/groups/strategic-advisory-group-of-experts-on-immunization/)(SAGE) took steps to incentivize uptake of HPV vaccines on a national scale: expanding the number of countries eligible for Gavi introduction support, reducing the dosing schedule from three to two doses, and allowing countries more flexibility in designing their programs. These [policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106399) and [financing](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182663) adjustments led to a surge in demand, peaking with a record [16 national introductions ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106399)in 2019. At the same time, the [United States ](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-hpv-vaccine-access-and-use-in-the-u-s/)recommended HPV vaccine use for adults up to [45 years old ](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-expanded-use-gardasil-9-include-individuals-27-through-45-years-old)leading companies to prioritize sales to this expanded market, and leaving behind low- and middle-income countries where the burden of disease is greater. The continuing supply shortages have delayed country introductions and left many adolescent girls unprotected and missing a critical link to access the health system.

**Harnessing Innovation to Improve Supply**

There are only a handful of licensed manufacturers capable of producing the authorized HPV vaccines, and they were [unable ](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/document/hpv-supply-and-procurement--roadmappdf.pdf)to scale up to accommodate the unexpected surges in demand after 2016. This has contributed to enduring [limitations](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30860-4) on global supply that [continue ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/position_paper_documents/human-papillomavirus-(hpv)/pp-hpv-may2017-summary.pdf?sfvrsn=cc5bf93e_2)to [restrict ](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329963/WER9447-541-559-eng-fre.pdf)the scale and reach of HPV vaccination programs.

Although shortages are expected to continue until at least 2024, there are [signs ](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/hpv-vaccine-manufacturers-commit-provide-enough-supply-immunize-least-84-million)that supply constraints are [beginning ](https://www.merck.com/news/expansion-of-elkton-virginia-manufacturing-facility-to-further-increase-mercks-hpv-vaccine-supply-and-support-broader-and-equitable-access/)to [ease](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/mi4a/who-mi4a-global-market-study-hpv.pdf?sfvrsn=649561b3_1&download=true). The new bivalent vaccine Cecolin®—manufactured by Chinese company Innovax—[received WHO prequalification ](https://www.path.org/media-center/new-hpv-vaccine-innovax-receives-who-prequalification/)in October 2021, and is available to countries with Gavi support. Two additional products from [Walvax ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/mi4a/who-mi4a-global-market-study-hpv.pdf?sfvrsn=649561b3_1&download=true)(China) and [Serum Institute of India ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-indias-first-hpv-vaccine-could-mean-for-fight-against-cervical-cancer-8027690/)have been [licensed](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(22)00567-8) in their respective countries, and [another candidate ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/mi4a/who-mi4a-global-market-study-hpv.pdf?sfvrsn=649561b3_1&download=true)from the China National Biotec Group (Sinopharm) has entered phase 3 trials. Additional manufacturers in developing countries are [expected ](https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5406/file/Human-Papillomavirus-Vaccine-Market-%20Update-October202#:\~:text=Global%20HPV%20vaccine%20supply%20availability,45.5%20million%20doses%20in%202021.)to enter the market.

A new policy recommendation may help alleviate cost and supply challenges further: in April 2022, the WHO SAGE [advised ](https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer)that countries could switch from a two-dose vaccination regimen to an off-label single-dose schedule, given that [one dose ](https://www.path.org/articles/single-dose-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer/)of HPV vaccine [showed](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00453-8) high [protection](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.12.017) against the most [carcinogenic](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1470-2045(10)70230-8) strains of HPV. There are major [financial ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/reproductive-health/sage_april2022meetinghighlights_11apr2022_final.pdf?sfvrsn=21bcfb4f_3)and [operational ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anita-zaidi_one-dose-human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-activity-6919380806255656960-vLQm/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web)benefits to this shift, which would functionally double the supply of vaccine courses by cutting the dosage in half. Single dosing would also eliminate the need to follow up with clients for subsequent doses or conduct costly “catch-up” campaigns, which have been persistent challenges for reaching populations with multi-dose vaccines, including Covid-19 vaccines.

But [uncertainties ](https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer)remain about single dosing, and the switch must be made with caution. It will be important to [strengthen screening programs ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.04.014)to ensure that single-dose immunity [endures](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.067) in the long-term as women age and their risk of developing cervical cancer increases. Especially if more low-resource countries adopt single dosing, this monitoring and evaluation will be critical to avoid an inequitable two-tiered approach to protection. And the single-dosing decision does not apply to some of the highest [burden](https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS2214-109X(19)30482-6) populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, including the population of immunodeficient HIV-positive women, which needs multiple doses to achieve protection and are the most vulnerable to HPV infection, with [six times ](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/routine-vaccines/extraordinary-impact-hpv)the likelihood of developing cervical cancer.

Efforts to build widespread demand for and strong delivery of HPV vaccines have been limited in recent years as supply struggled to keep pace. Now, as these new innovations allow manufacturers to expand and stabilize global supply, global demand must also rise to meet it to sustain the marketplace.

**Designing a Delivery Platform**

Compared to interventions for younger children and infants, there are fewer established opportunities to reach adolescents with health services. And neither childhood immunization nor reproductive and maternal health programs are positioned to assume responsibility for programs for adolescent girls. This has left HPV vaccination programs at a [disadvantage](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.066) because they are limited in their ambitions by constraints on [supply](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.01.036) and funding; this also leaves adolescents more vulnerable to falling through the cracks of the wider healthcare system.

Given these limitations, countries have [had ](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/immunization/stories/cdc-evaluates-hpv-vaccine-introduction.html)to [weigh](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106335) various [tradeoffs ](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/Summary-of-CDC-HPV-evaluation.pdf)as they [design](https://doi.org/10.2471%2FBLT.11.089862) their HPV vaccination programs and concentrate on the age and approach through which they expect to achieve the highest initial coverage based on local circumstances. Countries with [high](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106399) adolescent school enrollment, such as [India](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.024) or [Zimbabwe](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/Summary-of-CDC-HPV-evaluation.pdf), may opt for [school](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/school-based-targeting-increases-hpv-vaccination-rates)-[based](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.11.008) HPV vaccination campaigns, even if those programs may be [costly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29016596/), time-intensive, and [leave ](https://immunizationeconomics.org/recent-activity/2022/4/22/new-evidence-on-the-cost-of-delivering-hpv-vaccines-through-schools-in-zimbabwe)limited [resources](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines3020408) to [reach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.024) out-of-school girls. Some countries with strong routine health services, such as [Senegal or Tanzania](https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/Summary-of-CDC-HPV-evaluation.pdf), may elect for a mix of outreach at schools and fixed health facilities. Others may rely on fixed health facilities over community outreach, because of the lower operational costs.

The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated the fragility of all these approaches, as pandemic [restrictions ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/minding-gap-global-immunization-coverage)closed schools and facilities, limited community outreach programs, and raised the [costs ](https://thinkwell.global/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-19-impact-on-campaigns-9-June-2020.pdf)for all immunization activities. Since HPV vaccination tends to be managed separately from routine childhood immunization, it was among the one of the first programs to be put on hold as healthcare workers were diverted to the Covid-19 response. Global HPV vaccination coverage, which already lagged behind coverage against other vaccine-preventable diseases, continues to [backslide](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/), having fallen to just [12 percent ](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/immunisation-lower-income-countries-pandemic-leads-decline-coverage-signs-recovery)in 2021—and even [lower ](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/hpv-vaccine-cuts-cervical-cancer-cases-nearly-90)in Gavi-supported countries. Since the beginning of the pandemic, [3.5 million more ](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/wuenic-progress-and-challenges-15-july-2022.pdf?sfvrsn=b5eb9141_7&download=true)eligible girls have missed out on HPV vaccination, and even more girls lost access due to increasing strain on healthcare resources and [delays](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106399) or postponement of new introductions. And the longer pandemic disruptions [continue](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/immunization/wuenic-progress-and-challenges-15-july-2022.pdf?sfvrsn=b5eb9141_7&download=true), as more girls miss their vaccinations or drop out of school completely, the more intensive the [effort ](https://www.jsi.com/three-lessons-from-hpv-to-consider-for-covid-19-vaccine-introduction/)will be required to reach those girls once programs resume.

Since the impact of HPV vaccination has long-delayed returns, countries have prioritized more immediately deadly outbreaks of diseases such as [measles](https://www.devex.com/news/is-a-measles-spike-a-bellwether-for-other-vaccine-preventable-outbreaks-103147), focusing on [restarting](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30496-1/fulltext) those campaigns. Other countries are keen to introduce the new but expensive and supply limited [malaria vaccine](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-worlds-first-malaria-shot-wont-reach-millions-children-who-need-it-2022-07-13/). Finding creative ways to integrate HPV vaccination with those campaigns or [other](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fheapol%2Fczv119) targeted [adolescent](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pvr.2017.08.003) and family [services](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fijgo.13482) may help [increase](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.021) the value of HPV vaccination to health officials and political leaders amid constraints on health budgets and health worker bandwidth, and enable programs to endure in the face of future shocks. These [services ](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/options-for-linking-health-interventions-for-adolescents-with-hpv-vaccination)may [include ](https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2851_HPV-HIV-cervicalcancer_en.pdf)HIV [prevention ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/five-years-dreams-and-what-lies-ahead)and [treatment](https://www.bushcenter.org/explore-our-work/taking-action/partnership-to-end-aids-and-cervical-cancer.html), malaria prevention, and sexual and reproductive health services, depending on the country context. At the same time, bundling HPV vaccination within a broader [suite of services ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/time-address-intersecting-crises-covid-19-hiv-and-gender-inequality)can help soften the [stigma ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/five-years-dreams-and-what-lies-ahead)and community sensitivity that may arise when discussing a health intervention against a sexually transmitted virus. Countries can integrate services across existing [sites](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.066) where families are likely to seek healthcare services, such as pediatric offices, and collocate many different programs to make adolescent services more [accessible](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253735) and economical for families.

**Sustaining Demand**

As the Covid-19 response has [shown](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/covid-shots-are-finally-arriving-africa-cant-get-them-all-into-arms-2021-12-06/), the availability of vaccines is not always accompanied by a demand for vaccination. To be fully effective, efforts to expand the reach of vaccinators must be complemented by equally strong efforts to ensure that once adolescents can access vaccines, [they](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.011) and their [parents](https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2022.2036555) are aware of them and inclined to accept them.

This will [require ](https://www.jsi.com/hpv-vaccine-introduction-learning-and-adapting-in-the-time-of-covid-19/)significant [investment ](https://immunizationeconomics.org/recent-activity/2022/4/22/new-evidence-on-the-cost-of-delivering-hpv-vaccines-through-schools-in-zimbabwe)year after year, beyond the limited timeline for Gavi introduction grants: finding [time](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.024) and [resources](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.11.057) to [train](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.074) and empower healthcare workers, especially [female ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/gender-responsive-programming-improve-immunization-services)healthcare workers; [identifying](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.07.025) all the eligible girls in the age cohort; and performing social mobilization to encourage adolescents to [seek out](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.047) the vaccines.

[Much](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21912-x) more [education ](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/who-says-just-one-dose-hpv-vaccine-protects-against-cervical-cancer)and community [outreach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.025) is [needed](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.042) to make the link between immunization, cancer prevention, and women’s health more explicit for health workers, schoolteachers, and families, and to convince parents that the time and cost of seeking vaccination services for their adolescent daughters will be worth their while. It will be critical to consider what messages and messengers—perhaps [including ](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/lesotho-mothers-welcome-reintroduction-hpv-vaccine)cancer survivors or their family and friends—will be the most effective in championing the value of early prevention through vaccination, and achieving lasting [behavior change](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-story-telling-helping-girls-access-hpv-vaccine-ethiopia-and-tanzania). The most effective methods, such as peer mentorship and social mobilization platforms, will and indeed already have yielded dividends far beyond HPV vaccination by building adolescent awareness of safety measures during the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/kenyas-hpv-vaccine-strategies-re-activated-covid-19), and they could be used similarly in the case of future emergencies and for future adolescent vaccines.

This personalized, proactive [outreach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106335) is also a more effective [counterpoint ](https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/personal-stories-power-anti-vaccine-misinfo/)to [misinformation ](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hpv-vaccination-japan-0)and stigma, which has [been](https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2018.1564436) especially [pernicious](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30010-4) in regard to HPV and Covid-19 vaccines. Countries have taken different approaches to mitigate rumors and achieve higher levels of coverage. In Zimbabwe, the more unfamiliar Covid-19 and HPV vaccines were delivered at the same time as more established, trusted childhood vaccines such as inactivated polio vaccines. This demonstrates the extra value that HPV vaccination could have, were it to become more widely accepted, in paving the way for new vaccines against unknown threats.

### **A Smart Investment**

With global attention focused on raising the coverage of routine immunizations that have [languished ](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/WUENIC2022release)during the Covid-19 pandemic, now is a critical [moment ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/progress-on-hpv-vaccines-is-too-important-to-lose/2022/09/26/59e53010-3da4-11ed-8c6e-9386bd7cd826_story.html)to regain momentum. There is high-level commitment to expanding HPV vaccination among multinational and bilateral partners: in November 2020 the WHO released its [_Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem_](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240014107) for 2030, which ambitiously calls for 90 percent of girls to be fully vaccinated against HPV by the time they are 15 years old. The United States has been an active player through the efforts of the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/13/17-0603_article), [the National Academies](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/expanding-cervical-cancer-screening-and-preventive-therapy-ccspt-through-introducing-new-technologies-and-integrating-with-voluntary-family-planning), the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ([PEPFAR](https://www.state.gov/partnership-to-end-aids-and-cervical-cancer/)), and [the U.S. Agency for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1869/Report_on_Human_Papillomavirus.pdf), through its [support ](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-government-gavi-the-vaccine-alliance/)of Gavi. But in the face of recent regression, there is a need for a revitalized approach to recover HPV vaccination coverage and put programs back on a forward-leaning trajectory.

Many proven, localized, creative strategies to improve the performance of HPV vaccination programs are simply waiting to be scaled. The United States and its bilateral and multilateral allies will need to work with low- and middle-income country partners to stabilize the marketplace, better integrate services, and mobilize communities, one clinic and school at a time. These efforts will provide enormous returns by expanding service delivery for adolescent girls and eliminating preventable cervical cancer deaths for decades to come. But the wider, strategic investment may prove equally valuable in the near term by building a bulwark against the next inevitable pandemic threat.
