_This podcast with European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and European Union Ebola Coordinator Christos Stylianides, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series "Take as Directed", examines the European Union’s role in the May-June 2018 Ebola response effort, with comparisons to the 2014 Ebola response on which much of today’s understanding of global health security is built.  Following the recording of this podcast, the CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security hosted a private lunch discussion with Dr. Stylianides._

Dr. Christos Stylianides serves as the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and is the European Union Ebola Coordinator. In this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_, Dr. Stylianides joins CSIS Commission on Strengthening America’s Health Security Secretariat Director J. Stephen Morrison to discuss how the April-June 2018 Ebola response in DRC has differed from the response in 2014 and the leading role that Europe is playing in that response. He also discusses his current work to expand resources for education services for children and adolescents in crises and emergency situations.
