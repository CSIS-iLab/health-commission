_This podcast with Kee B. Park, recorded for the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series_ Take as Directed, _illuminates the challenges of the disordered world for health security through the case of North Korea._

Amidst a time of potentially historic talks between the U.S. and North Korea, this episode of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center podcast series _Take as Directed_ offers an inside look at the health challenges that North Korea faces and the opportunities for progress that can be made through key diplomatic steps. For this discussion, we turn to Dr. Kee B. Park, Paul Farmer Global Surgery Scholar at Harvard Medical School and Director of North Korea Programs for the Korean American Medical Association. Dr. Park has just returned from another trip to North Korea and joins CSIS Commission Secretariat Co-Director J. Stephen Morrison to discuss his latest visit, the potential impacts of economic sanctions on humanitarian engagement, and the operating environment that influenced the Global Fund's decision to close its TB and malaria programs. We conclude by hearing about some exciting new initiatives Dr. Park is pursuing to strengthen U.S.-North Korea collaboration in the health sector and his optimism looking forward.
