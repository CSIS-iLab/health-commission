There was **1 new case** reported on October 29th.

An investigation is still under way into a patient whose illness was confirmed on October 23 in Mandima and who fled into the community. Deaths that happen in the community raise the risk of disease spread.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has suspended some border screening services for Ebola after three of its aid workers were killed in South Sudan.

## IOM suspends some Ebola screening after three aid workers killed in South Sudan

The workers - two men and one woman - were hit by crossfire during clashes between rival armed groups in the country’s central Equatoria region. The deceased woman’s four-year-old son was abducted along with another local female IOM volunteer during the armed clash, the IOM said. Two other male volunteers were injured, including one who is recovering from a gunshot wound. IOM stopped screening for Ebola at five border points between South Sudan, Uganda and DRC.

It was not clear who was behind the latest fighting. In the past, government forces have clashed in the region with fighters from the rebel National Salvation Front, led by renegade former General Thomas Cirillo Swaka, who is not a party to a peace deal signed last year by President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar.

A key issue raised in part 2 of the series on #Ebola in the DRC: Survivors are tested on a regular basis after they are cured and are advised to use condoms to prevent them from infecting their partner until the test results are completely negative. #LifeAfterEbola

Shame to see this important program shut down. This type of program is expensive but is a global public good for all of humanity as we are all at risk for novel infectious diseases that may appear & spread [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/predict-usaid-viruses.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share") … via @NYTimes
