There were **13 new Ebola cases** in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as of June 18th, 2019

Over **300,000** people have fled an explosion of ethnic violence in northeastern DRC in the past two weeks, UN confirms.

To effectively “reset" efforts to contain Ebola, responders need to **increase the transparency** of their operations, said USAID Administrator Mark Green.

## Hundreds of Thousands Flee Congo Violence, in Region Afflicted by Ebola

The United Nations refugee agency said more than 300,000 people had fled DRC in the face of large-scale clashes between two ethnic groups, the Hema and the Lendu, in Ituri province, which borders Uganda and South Sudan. Officials however said that this estimate was conservative, “the figure could be way, way higher," Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the refugee agency, said, adding that the violence was preventing aid agencies from gaining access to the area. In a region that is no stranger to violent conflict, including clashes between the same two groups at the end of 2017, the rate at which people had been forced to flee appeared unprecedented, he added. The mass displacement poses a threat to efforts to tackle an Ebola outbreak that is the second worst recorded wave of cases, surpassed in scale only by the 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa.

## USAID chief: Key to containing Ebola is transparency

On his current nine-day trip to five African nations, including a visit to the North Kivu province of DRC, Mark Green met with health care workers responding to the crisis, community and local leaders, and representatives from NGOs. “A key challenge for those working to contain the spread of the virus is that the affected communities have little trust in the government and the foreign workers responding to the crisis", said Green. This means that people aren’t working with health teams to report cases early, for example. “**We have to undo some of the damage and distrust that has been built up over the years**," Green added. “You have people who are impoverished, who have lost faith in institutions, who see outsiders coming in — in some cases, they see them as being more concerned about the virus than they are about them." One example that Green gave in increasing transparency is the use of clear tarps at Ebola treatment centers, which allow communities to see the conditions in which family members are receiving treatment. “Those kinds of steps, which may be small from a technical standpoint, are extraordinarily important, from a community standpoint," he said.

1\. Another health worker has been infected with #Ebola, the 119th of this outbreak. It is not currently clear if this man was vaccinated. He is alive. To date, 39 of the HCW cases have died. The case fatality among health workers — 33% — is about half the overall case fatality.
