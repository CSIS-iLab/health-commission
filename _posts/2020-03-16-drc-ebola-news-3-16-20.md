March 13 was the 25th day since a new [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) case was reported in DRC. I've been keeping this graph for a while — it represents cases by day of report (it's not an epi curve). Every month I've had to find another color to use. I love that there are no green bars in March!
