## Ebola spreads in Congo after militants attack treatment camp: WHO

[_Reuters_<i/>{:class=”icon-external-link”}](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-ebola-who/ebola-spreads-in-congo-after-militants-attack-treatment-camp-who-idUSKBN1YH1GN){:target=”_blank”}{:rel=”noopener”}

_12/13/19_

Twenty-seven Ebola cases were confirmed in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the week through December 10, against an average of seven in the last three weeks, WHO said. Insecurity remains a large challenge because it prevents WHO from reaching communities to protect them against Ebola. A helicopter is to be used as an air bridge to ferry epidemiologists and vaccinators to insecure areas and bring them back the same day. More than 20 people from the stricken Biakato mine area were vaccinated on Thursday, according to WHO incident manager Dr. Michel Yao. “When we cannot access the community, we cannot perform surveillance activities including vaccination that has been one of the key innovations that help us really to stop the spread out of this country to others,” Yao said.
