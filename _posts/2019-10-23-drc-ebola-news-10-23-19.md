The deployment of additional support to the Biakato Mine Health Area has led to improvements in response efforts. The proportion of confirmed cases listed as contacts has increased in the past week from 13% to 57%. In the 21 days, the number of affected health areas has decreased, with 20 health areas and nine health zones reporting new cases. Improvements in response indicators in the past week are encouraging. However, substantive rates of transmission remain in Mandima Health Zone, with smaller clusters elsewhere, which require a concerted effort from all response teams and international partners to control. On 18 October, it was the view of the convened IHR Emergency Committee that the outbreak still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

The countries decided to create a special team of Coordination for Africa on the Ebola Virus (AFECT), which will be housed at the secretariat of the African Union in Addis Ababa, led by the DRC and 9 other Member States, with the support of the African CDC, WHO, and other relevant partners. "The African Union is moving towards the implementation of the 2063 Action Plan, which aspires to the political and economic integration of Africa, including the free movement of people across the continent. A multi-country effort to prepare for and respond to Ebola outbreaks will be a good example of how we use our collective capacities in this regard," said Elfadil Mohammed, AU Commissioner for Social Affairs.

6\. Another health worker has been infected with #Ebola. DRC hasn't announced it but I think it was one of Sunday's cases, a young man at Biakato Mines. He is alive. He was vaccinated but only a few days before falling ill. So far 163 health workers have been infected.
