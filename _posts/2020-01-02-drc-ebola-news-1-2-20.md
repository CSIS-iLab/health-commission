_Axios, 12/30/19_

Microbiologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe, current head of the Ebola outbreak efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, says community engagement combined with increased security and new medicines will halt the spread of the deadly virus. Muyembe discussed the challenges facing the DRC's battle with Ebola with Axios in an interview translated by Trad Hatton, director in the DRC for the nonprofit global public health organization PATH, which arranged the interview.

Significant advances have been made in understanding how to combat the virus, although the unique problems of this outbreak have so far stymied efforts to stamp it out completely, Muyembe says. However, cases continue spreading, including particularly worrisome community deaths that occur outside of medically secure areas. Continued bursts of violence in the community that sometimes target health teams — a persistent problem — are also very concerning, Muyembe says.

_CIDRAP, 12/27/19_

Over the past few days, four new Ebola cases were confirmed in one of the former hot spots in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) outbreak, Kalunguta, which had gone 63 days with no new cases. The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said in its daily report for Dec 25 that investigators are exploring how the first two patients in the new cluster­—sisters ages 7 and 5—were exposed to the virus. The CMRE said the first newly detected patient in Kalunguta, located in North Kivu province not far from Beni and Butembo, is a 7-year-old girl who had been vaccinated in 2018 and had not been listed as a contact. Her symptoms began on Dec 18, meaning she was probably exposed to the virus in the first half of December.

\#Ebola: There was 1 new case on Dec. 30. No deaths. Dec. 31 there were 3 cases. They were at Butembo & Katwa, which is tragic. Those areas — hugely problematic for the response last spring (ie violence) — had gone weeks without cases. This outbreak appears to be expanding.

I would like to start 2020 with positive thoughts and an optimistic outlook on how far we have come. Not only in the fight against #Ebola but in general.
