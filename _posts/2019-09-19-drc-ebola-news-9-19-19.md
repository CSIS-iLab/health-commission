Upon entering the nursery, all staff must have their hands and shoes disinfected with chlorine, and strict protocols are in place. Children are monitored in case they develop symptoms. In addition to 24-hour care, children receive specialized psychological and nutritional support. It’s a welcoming place, with rooms strewn with toys and walls painted with colorful cartoons. The nursery in Beni opened in November 2018 and was the first of its kind. Almost a year later, more than 375 children have passed through its doors. Eight other nurseries are located next to Ebola treatment centers across the DRC together caring for thousands of children.

Thanks to @DFID_UK for your immense support to the #Ebola response in the #DRC. @WHO senior officials Dr Soce Fall & Dr Caboré & partners visited a vaccination site in #Beni with @DFID delegation to show first-hand how this support is saving lives.
