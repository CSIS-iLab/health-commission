There were 2 **new cases** reported on January 28th.

New confirmed cases continue to be reported in Beni, Mabalako, and Butembo in North Kivu Province. One health zone, Beni, has reported new confirmed cases in the past seven days. Enhanced surveillance performance has helped ensure faster isolation of sick individuals, which in turn decreases the likelihood of infection in the community.

[#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) update: 1 case yesterday, at Beni. Beni has had all the cases over the past week. 0 deaths. Outbreak totals: 3418 cases, 2240 deaths. [#Ebola](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ebola?src=hashtag_click) transmission looks like it's almost as low in January as it was in November, when it looked like the outbreak might be stuttering towards its end. Make it be so now. Please.
