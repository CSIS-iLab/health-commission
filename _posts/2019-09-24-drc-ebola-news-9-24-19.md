In a [statement](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/who-rationing-ebola-vaccines-outbreak-still-not-under-control) released yesterday, MSF’s director of operations said that at least 2,000 people could be receiving the vaccine each day, instead of the maximum of 1,000 who are vaccinated daily currently. MSF has also called for the establishment of an "an independent, international coordination committee to facilitate more transparent management of the Ebola vaccination program". Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, wrote that such a committee could apply only to commercially licensed vaccines; the current vaccine requires more scientific research before being licensed. Ryan also defended WHO’s strategies, saying the UN agency is not limiting vaccine access but rather implementing recommendation by an independent advisory body of experts (SAGE) in agreement with the DRC government.

A Tanzanian government spokesman said on Twitter that WHO country representative Tigest Ketsela Mengestu was summoned by deputy foreign affairs minister Damas Ndumbaro in Dar es Salaam. “The representative insisted that the WHO has not declared that there is Ebola in Tanzania, nor does it have any evidence on that and pledged to cooperate with the government,” he said. Officially, the Tanzanian government had said it had no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola. The government did not address the death of the woman directly and did not provide further information.

The fight against #Ebola requires regional & international cooperation. Tanzania's @MagufuliJP and @ForeignTanzania should make information available in line with its commitments under the global health security agenda to prevent infectious disease from spreading across borders.

This report has incredible and awful details on the ongoing, largely ignored crisis in eastern DRC by @KivuSecurity. This suggests the rate of killings in just 2 Congo provinces, N and S Kivu, exceeds the rate of killing in Yemen …[https://kivusecurity.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/reports/28/KST%20biannual%20report%20August%2012%20%281%29.pdf](https://kivusecurity.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/reports/28/KST%20biannual%20report%20August%2012%20%281%29.pdf "https://kivusecurity.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/reports/28/KST%20biannual%20report%20August%2012%20%281%29.pdf") …
