"I am speaking with you today because I care deeply about our country, and I need your help to stop the Ebola outbreak in the north part of the country. Ebola is real. The current outbreak is the country’s largest ever," Mutombo, who is from the DRC, says in a video posted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mutombo moved to the U.S. in the 1980s to pursue a medical degree at Georgetown University. He told The Associated Press that he understands where distrust of Western medical help comes from. “Someone who doesn’t look like you, who doesn’t think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walk to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... ‘inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.’ That’s where there’s a fight. This is where we’re having a conflict," he said. “**I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health**."

Today's attack in Beni is the latest against health workers trying to combat the virus that has killed more than 1,500 people in eastern Congo since the outbreak began last August. Col. Safari Kazingufu told The Associated Press that authorities were working to find the attackers and to protect the health teams out in the field. The current response efforts to the outbreak have been severely hindered by community mistrust and fear.
