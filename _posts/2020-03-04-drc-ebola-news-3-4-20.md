The last patient being treated for Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo was discharged on Tuesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, bringing the 19-month-old outbreak closer than ever to an end. Congo has now gone 14 days without any new confirmed cases. The outbreak can be declared over once 42 days have passed without a new case - equivalent to two cycles of 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus.

The last Ebola patient being treated in the Democratic Republic of Congo went home from a treatment center on Tuesday, according to the World Health Organization, a significant step in the countdown to declaring an end to the world's second-deadliest outbreak of the disease. The woman was released from the center in Beni town, one of the hotspots of the recent outbreak, which began August 2018, the agency said in a statement. "It is not yet the end of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We must stay vigilant in the coming weeks and beyond," WHO regional director for Africa Dr. Matshidiso Moetisaid in the statement.

\#Ebola treatment centre in Beni discharges another patient. Beni was the only zone reporting cases, but for 15 days there has been no new case in the health zone. #Ebola responders remain vigilant to help prevent the emergence of new cases in #DRCongo
