In an interview with KomaEbola on Tuesday, Beni's Ebola local coordinator, Dr. Pierre Adikey, said **no case has been reported in the health zone since last week**. "But we have contacts that are still in their period of follow-up," Adikey said, before insisting on surveillance and vigilance within the community in order to permanently end the epidemic. He reminded that anyone who has been in contact with a case, a patient or a death of the virus disease Ebola must be followed by agents of the response.

## In Congo, a ‘militarised’ Ebola response has fuelled community resistance

_10/2/19_

A [July report](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24808&LangID=E) from the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights highlighted the "disproportionate use of force" by police and army personnel dealing with protests against Ebola responders. The security forces have also imposed Ebola prevention measures by force, such as safe burials, according to testimonies collected from several mourners and burial teams. In recent months, there have been fewer reports of violence surrounding the Ebola response. Still, the impact of earlier violence lingers in communities within the outbreak region.

**Several aid agencies have warned against the use of security forces by the Ebola response, which Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has described as “militarisation”**. The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) explained that “increasing armed protection for Ebola responders may aggravate the tensions that already exist between communities and responders”. Aid groups say lack of trust in the response among residents in the outbreak area has stalled containment efforts, allowing the virus to spread. The distrust has also contributed to over 200 attacks on responders and treatment centres since January, leaving at least seven health workers dead.

The WHO has explained community resistance towards Ebola workers as the product of “decades of suspicion” that ordinary people hold towards a central government that has been unable to protect them. **Residents have said their** **mistrust in the national government was confirmed last year when long overdue presidential elections were postponed again in Beni and nearby Butembo** – while most of the rest of the country voted – ostensibly to prevent the spread of Ebola. They also said **they viewed the outbreak, which has seen a large influx of foreign aid, as a profit-making enterprise for aid agencies and government officials.** Beyond these factors, those interviewed also offered another reason for the breakdown in trust: the violence they said they face from the Ebola response itself, especially from the DRC security forces.

The drop in cases in North Kivu shows that community acceptance is key to fight #Ebola. But the outbreak is not over yet & we need to continue working with the communities and listen to their concerns. #OnEstEnsemble [https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2019/09/30/ebola-outbreak-2nd-largest-since-2014-2016-2000-lives-lost/](https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2019/09/30/ebola-outbreak-2nd-largest-since-2014-2016-2000-lives-lost/ "https://www.cnbcafrica.com/videos/2019/09/30/ebola-outbreak-2nd-largest-since-2014-2016-2000-lives-lost/") … via @cnbcafrica

Violence in #Ituri #DRCongo is helping #Ebola spread there. Mandima is now a hotspot after Ebola responders paused work for 13 days due to conflict. @WHO reports that the virus is spreading undetected as contacts are lost & new cases not reported.

How much difference did it make in North Kivu-Ituri that the long-running #Ebola outbreak there was declared a #PHEIC — a Public Health Emergency of International Concern? Not one iota, says@curefinder in an interesting Q&A.
